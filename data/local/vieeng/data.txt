tét	(noun) New Year's Day, Tet festival; To the Vietnamese people, Tết Nguyên Đán (Lunar New Year's Day) is very sacred. The Tết season usually falls on either the second half of the first calendar month, or the early days of the second calendar month of the year. This is the time when family members together make food, fruit and incense offerings on the family altars to commemorate their ancestors. This is also the time for people to visit their neighbours, their friends and relatives. During the first three or four days of Tết, any visitor who is the first visitor to one's house to offer Tết greetings would be considered as the first visitor for the year (Xông đất). Their good or bad luck would have a strong effect on the house owner's business success for the coming year. The belief of Xông đất remains very strong nowadays, especially among business people. Tết days are always regarded as a perfect time for people to enjoy traditional food such as bánh chưng, a square-shaped sticky rice cake, the fragrance of which alone could strongly provoke one's sense of nostalgia for Tết; WHAT TẾT MEANS FOR HANOIAN CHRISTIANS Hà Nội (originally called Thăng Long) was an early site for the propagation of Christianity. Phan Phát Huờn, author of ""Việt Nam Giáo Sử"" Vol.1 (A History of Religion in Vietnam), writes that in 1581, a missionary named De Pesaro wrote a letter and sent pictures depicting the history of Christianity to Mạc Mậu Hợp (the then ruler of Thăng Long). In 1584, another missionary, Bartholomew Ruiz of the Franciscan Order from Manila, came with an interpreter to Northern Vietnam (then called Tonkin) and Thăng Long. He was warmly received by Mạc Mậu Hợp and allowed to hold his services and ceremonies. In 1626, Father Baldinoti arrived in Thăng Long and was greeted by Trịnh Tráng, the then Lord of the North. He was also granted permission to hold services for the public. This put the Christian faith in Vietnam well on its way. A real landmark came in 1627, when missionary Alexandre de Rhodes came to Hà Nội on July 2 after Lord Trịnh Tráng returned from his expedition to the South. This event effected a marked change in the propagation of Christianity in Northern Vietnam. From just a wooden hut provided by Trịnh Tráng, Rhodes set up a small prayer-hall to preach his faith and by the end of 1627, he had baptised over 1,200 people. In 1628, another ,000 were baptised, with this number growing to 3,500 in 1629. At the same time, Rhodes romanised the Vietnamese language in order to further facilitate the spread of Christianity. He also wrote a book in Vietnamese called 'Christianity in Eight Days'. To provide a stronger base for Christianity, he incorporated local customs and traditions to his religious festivals and practices, especially during the Tết Festival period. The New Year festival, according to the local people's lunar calendar, is one of the most important annual events for the people of this agricultural economy. During the festival, people erect in front of their houses a high bamboo pole called a 'cây nêu' to ward off evil spirits. Taking full advantage of this tradition, he advised people, especially his Christian followers, to hang a cross on top of the pole to highlight theTrinity. He advised followers to offer prayers in the first three days of the New Year to the Holy Father, Holy Son and Holy Ghost and thanksgiving to the Trinity and saints of the religion. In 1805, the Bishop of Vietnam wrote to all Christians in Northern Vietnam during the New Year festival urging them to be brothers and offer each other good wishes, entertain and dine with each other. This remains a good and healthy practice. These practices were maintained until the 1960s, after which new ones were introduced. For instance, the second day of the New Year is used to commemorate ancestors, in keeping with the Vietnamese custom. Interestingly, Vietnamese Christians have included various Christian festivals in the lunar calendar. Following the Trinity festival and the Candle festival comes Tết. Thus, they say: 'Ba Vua, Lễ Nến, Tết đến sau lưng' (If Epiphany and Candlemas have come, Tết cannot be far behind). Christian churches also prepare for Tết putting up beautiful decorations and engaging in communal activities

còng	(noun) Gong; Ten years ago, the central highlands resounded with the echoes of an array of gongs. The Pleiku township in Gia Lai province was hosting the first ""Cồng Chiêng"" festival (Festival of gongs). Twelve Cồng Chiêng bands with 438 artists belonging to various ethnic minorities such as the Ê Đê, Gia Rai, Ba Na, Xơ Đăng presented a series of virtuoso performances. Seventy years separated the oldest and the youngest player Three years later, in 1988, participants numbered 1,000 from 14 ethnic groups from as many provinces. The deep sounds and melodies left an indelible impression on the large audience. The sounds of the Cồng and the Chiêng (Cồng has a knob in the middle, Chiêng has none -- Cồng makes the deep bass sounds, melodies are coaxed out of the Chiêng) are the very soul of the highlands. They are played to commemorate good harvests, at religious festivals and on many other occasions like child-birth, weddings, and funerals. Indeed, it is believed by the highlanders that a divine entity resides in each Cồng and Chiêng. In many communities, a Cồng Chiêng band consists of three Cồngs, nine Chiêngs, a drum and cymbals played by about twenty artistes. The compositions played differ, of course, with each festival and occasion --, lively, melancholic or sombre. The Cồng Chiêng in Vietnam's central highlands is the subject of study for many anthropologists, musicians, and ""orientalists"". Figures of Cồng Chiêng teams can be found on bronze drums which date back to 3000 years ago. This suggests that these instruments made their appearance in the early days among ethnic tribes such as Thái, and Mường in northern Vietnam, and Koho, Kor, Ba Na, Stieng, Mnong, in the central highlands. With recent economic and cultural developments, many musical instruments have made their way to the central highlands, but the Cồng Chiêng will remain intricately woven into the fabric of a highlander's life for ever. -- ()

hớ	(noun) Vietnamese chanty, work song; Ho Hue (Hue chanty): With high lyric quality, Hue chanty is closely attached to the everyday working life. They play the O chanty with a passionate tune when treading water, mowing weed, harrowing, or following a buffalo treading on paddy. They play the Do Hay chanty with a slow and sad tune when doing some light piece of job (hashing potatoes, chopping marsh-lentil, weaving cloth, lulling a babỵ..). The Ho Bui chanty has a+reasonably fast and rythmical air: One puts forward a tune, and another responds. They play the Nen chanty when building a road or a dyke, the Nen Voi chanty when pounding lime, even the Gia Gao chanty when grinding rice... The river chanties consist of Day Nuoc (pushing water), Mai Day (played when an overloaded boat crosses a waterfall, a very fast flow or strong waves) with very lively parallel sentences, and Dua Ghe (boat race). With no sneering hints, the Mai Nhi tender chanty alluding to warm trysts and heart-rending moans is played when the weather is attractively calm. In addition, there are Ru con (lulling a baby) and Dua Linh (attending a funeral) chanties

múa rối	Puppetry, art of puppet-showing, marionnette-show, puppet-play; Mua roi nuoc (water puppetry) is common throughout the world. Water puppetry was developed in lake and pond-rich areas in the Red River Delta The surface of water serves as the stage while spectators sit at the water's edge. The puppeteers both male and female stand waist-deep in the water to manipulate the puppets making them move about and even dance on the surface of the water. The water serves not only to hide the puppeteers and the puppets' strings but also to create a trembling stage full of reflection, while providing natural amplification for singing puppeteers accompanied by percussion music and fire crackers. Every puppet is a piece of real folk sculpture. It is made of wood, painted with waterproof lacquer. The prominent character is buffoon Teu with a plump body and a humorous smile. When the curtain is raised, the merry, arch Teu enters onto the stage and introduces the play. A considerable repertoire of traditional water puppet plays still get a big hand from the audience They include Teu Dance, Buffalo Fighting, Duck Tender Chasing Fox and Chess Playing

trau	(noun) Betel; Quid of betel (and areca-nut); Ăn trầu (Betel chewing): A popular custom formed in Vietnam since time immemorial. Each quid of betel consists of a piece of areca-nut and a betel leaf with no lime spread on it, and in some cases, included with a piece of tobacco. Traditionally, Vietnamese people invite their guests to chew betel before starting a conversation. This explains thoroughly the saying known to everyone: ""A quid of betel and areca-nut starts the ball rolling""; Ăn trầu là tập tục có từ thời cổ.

Ha Noi	Hà Nội is the political capital of Vietnam. Hà Nội lies in Red River Delta and is situated in a tropical area having a strong monsoon influence. The name of Hà Nội (Interior side of a river) has been+derived from an ancient language which is literally known as a land area located in the inner side of Red River. It does not mean that the city is inside the river, but it is embraced by about 100 km of the Red River dykes. Hà Nội has four inner precincts (Hoàn Kiếm, Ba Đình, Hai Bà Trưng, Đống Đa) and five suburban districts (Từ Liêm, Thanh Trì, Gia Lâm, Đông Anh and Sóc Sơn). From the time when the first State of ancient Vietnam was established, Hà Nội (formerly Thăng+Long) has been considered a sacred and typical part of Vietnam. It was in the autumn of 1010 that Lý Công Ờân (also known as Lý Thái Tổ) - the founder of Nhà Hậu Lý (Post-Ly Dynasty) - removed the court from Hoa Lư (present-day Ninh Bình province) to Đại La Citadel which was later renamed as Thăng Long. As soon as the royal fleet with King Lý Thái Tổ aboard cast anchors at the landing wharf in the Nhị River (present-day Red River), there ascended a golden dragon. Thinking that it was a good omen for his trip, King Lý Thái Tổ had Đại La Citadel renamed Thăng Long (Ascending Dragon). He also had Hoa Lư - his former capital - renamed Trường Yên. 1397 was the year marking an end to the decline of Nhà Hậu Lê (Post-Le Dynasty). It was the time when the king indulged himself in entertainments. Hồ Quý Ly, a high-ranking court+official, overthrew the king and proclaimed himself the king of a new dynasty - Hồ Dynasty. This dynasty removed the court to Tây Đô (Western Capital) in Thanh Hoá province. Thăng Long was then renamed Đông Đô (Eastern Capital). In 1407, the Ming aggressors defeated the army of Hồ Dynasty. They rushed to Đông Đô Citadel and renamed it Đông Quan Citadel. In 1418, a farmer whose name was Lê Lợi (future Lê Thái Tổ) grouped an insurrection army in Lam Sơn district in Thanh Hoá province. He proclaimed himself as Bình Định Vương (King+of Pacification) and led the resistance against the aggressors for 10 years and regained national independence. He entered the then Đông Quan Citadel and the next year, he renamed the citadel as Đông Kinh (Eastern Imperial City). In 1527, when a new dynasty - Nhà Mạc (Mac Dynasty) - was in the control of the country, the citadel resumed its former name (Thăng Long). In 1802, King Gia Long established the first court of Nhà Nguyễn (Nguyễn Dynasty) in Phú Xuân in the central coastal city of Huế. Thăng Long was then used as the regional capital exercising+influence on 11 northern citadels. But the word LONG which literally meant RũNG (Dragon) was changed to 'long' which was understood as 'thịnh' (Prosperity). In 1831, King Minh Mạng established the province of Hà Nội which includes the ancient Thăng Long Citadel and the districts of Từ Liêm, ứng Hoà, Thường Tín and Lý Nhân. In 1888, after the tragic defeat of Nhà Nguyễn (Nguyễn Dynasty), Hà Nội became a colonial city until 1954. Hà Nội capital was liberated from French colonialists on October 10, 1954. After April 30, 1975, Hà Nội was+officially recognized as the capital of Vietnam by the communist goverment. In the old days, each of 36 guild streets in Hà Nội had its+name closely associated with the trade and occupation of the inhabitants Now, Hà Nội has 381 streets representing a tenfold increase as compared with the ancient Hà Nội with 36 guild streets only. These are some tourist attractions of Hà Nội; Chùa một cột (One-pillar Pagoda): Its original name was Diên Hựu (long-lasting happiness and good luck). Legend has it that King Lý Thái Tôn was very old and had no son of his own. Therefore, he often went to pagodas to pray for Buddha's blessing so that he might have a son.+One night, he had a dream that he was granted a private audience with Buddha with a male baby in his hands. Buddha, sitting on a lotus flower in a square-shaped lotus pond in the western side of Thăng Long Citadel,+gave the king the baby. Months later, the queen got pregnant and gave birth to a male child. To repay gift from Buddha, the king ordered the construction of a pagoda which was supported by only one pillar resembling a lotus seat on which Buddha had been seated. The pagoda was dedicated to Buddha; Quốc Tử Giám (Temple of Literature) was built in 1070 as a dedication to the founder of Confucianism. Six years later, Quốc Tử Giám - the first university of Vietnam - was built in the premises of Văn Miếu. Quốc Tử Giám was the first school for princes and children of royal family members. In 1482, King Lê Thánh Tôn ordered+the erection of steles with inscription of all the names, birth dates and birth places of doctors and other excellent graduates who took part in examinations since 1442. Each stela is placed on the back of a turtle representing the nation's longevity. During Nhà Nguyễn (Nguyễn Dynasty), Temple of Literature was moved to Phú Xuân (Huế Royal City); Chùa Kim Liên (Kim Lien Pagoda): Legend has it that in the 12th century, Princess Tu Hoa, daughter of King Lý Thần Tôn, led her ladies-in-waiting to this area. They cultivated mulberry and silkworms to make silk. Later, a pagoda was built right on the site and by 1771, it was named Kim Liên (Golden Lotus); Chùa Quán Sứ (Quan Su Pagoda) was built in the 17th century. It is located in the street of the same name. Since 1958, Vietnam Buddhism Association has used this pagoda as its head office; Đền Quan Thánh (Quan Thanh Temple): The three ancient Chinese characters which are still seen today on the top of the entrance to the temple mean Tran Vu Quan. Literally, the temple is dedicated to Saint Tran Vụ Temples are places for worshipping saints while pagodas are dedicated+to Buddha and faithful disciplines. Saint Tran Vu was a legendary figure which was a combination between a legendary character in Vietnam's legend and a mystic character derived from Chinás legend. In Vietnam's legend, he was a saint who had earned the merits of assisting Thục Phán (future King An Dương Vương) in getting rid of ghost spirit during the construction of Cổ Loa Citadel. An Dương Vương Temple in Cổ Loa Citadel (Đông Anh district) is also named Thuong Temple. Inside it, there are An Dương Vu+o+ng's bronze statue (cast in 1897) and a big arbalest symbolizing the magic arbalest in the old days. In Chinás+legend, Saint Tran Vu was a saint who had made many contributions in safeguarding the northern border. Quan Thánh Temple was built during the reign of King Lý Thái Tổ (1010-1028). Special attention should be paid to the black bronze statue of Saint Tran Vụ Another object of no less+significance is a smaller black bronze statue of Old Trong, a chief artisan of the bronze casting team who had made the giant statue of Saint Tran Vu and the great bell on top of the entrance; Đền Hai Bà Trưng (Hai Bà Trưng Temple) is also called Đồng Nhân Temple, because it is located in Đồng Nhân village, Hai Bà Trưng precinct. Built in 1142 under the reign of King Lý Anh Tôn, it is dedicated to the two Vietnamese heroines Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị. On+the 5th and 6th days of the lunar second month, there is a grand festival at this temple to commemorate the two national heroines; Hồ Tây (West Lake) & Đường Thanh Niên (Youth Road): Youth Road can be compared to a beautiful bridge spanning across the two large bodies of water - West Lake to the northwest and Trúc Bạch Lake to the southeast. Covering an area of nearly 500 hectares, Hồ Tây was also+called Dam Dam (Misty Pond), Lang Bac (White Waves)....Oral tradition has it that Hồ Tây derived from a low-lying area upturned by a golden buffalo, so the stream derived from Hồ Tây was named Sông Kim Ngưu (Golden Buffalo River). As for Trúc Bạch Lake, legend has it that in the old days, Trúc Bạch Lake was where lived the abandoned ladies-in-waiting who were forced to weave silk. Therefore, beautiful silk was called Trúc Bạch (Silk of the Trúc village). As the biggest lake in the city, Hồ Tây is surrounded by many areas reputed for their traditional occupations: Yên Phụ and Nghi Tàm (silkworm-breeding and silk-weaving villages in the past), Quảng Bá, Nhật Tân (peach-growing village), Bưởi (paper-making village). In Tây Sơn times, Nguyễn Huy Lượng wrote Tụng Tây Hồ Phú (Eulogy for West Lake) so as to highlight the landscapes of the West Lake and Nguyễn Huệ (future Quang Trung)'s glorious merits. Now, Hồ Tây has been earmarked for the city's major+tourism development center; Hồ Hoàn Kiếm (Lake of Restored Sword): The name of this lake is derived from a legend having it that a fisherman named Lê Thân caught a sword blade when drawing the fish-net. Thân decided to offer it to his commanding general Lê Lợi (future Lê Thái Tổ). Afterwards, Lê Lợi found a hilt fitting that blade very well. This sword had always+been on his side during 10 years of resistance against Ming aggressors After winning over the foreign aggression, King Lê Thái Tổ returned to Thăng Long Citadel. One day, aboard a royal boat, he took a cruise in the Lục Thủy lake. Suddenly, a giant turtle emerged and came towards him.+The king withdrew his sword, and pinpointed with the sword the direction of the coming turtle for his soldiers' attention. All of a sudden, the turtle caught the sword between its teeth from the king's hand and submerged. The king thought that during the resistance against Ming aggressors, the genius had offered him this sword to help him defeat the enemy. At that time, the peace was returning, and the genius appeared to take back the sword. Consequently, King Lê Thái Tổ decided to name the Luc Thuy lake Hồ Hoàn Kiếm (Lake of Restored Sword). In the middle of the lake is Tháp Rùa (Turtle Tower). The lake abounds in big turtles+aged five or six hundred. When there are the changes in weather, they often emerge or expose themselves at the foot of the Turtle Temple; Đền Ngọc Sơn (Ngoc Son Temple): Initially, the temple was called Ngọc Sơn Pagoda. Later, it was renamed as Ngọc Sơn Temple, because it+was dedicated to the saints. Saint Van Xuong was a person considered the brightest star in Vietnam's literature and intellectual circles. Trần Hưng Đạo was worshipped because he was the national hero who led the Vietnamese people to a resounding victory over the Mongol aggression. The temple as it is seen today was attributable to the restoration efforts of Nguyễn Văn Siêu, a great Hanoian writer. He had a large pen-shaped tower (Tháp Bút) built at the entrance to the temple. On the upper section of Tháp Bút, there are three Chinese characters Tả Thanh Thiên which mean literally that to write on the blue sky is to imply the height of a genuine and righteous person's determination and will. Behind Tháp Bút is Đài Nghiên (Ink Stand). The Ink Stand is carved from stone resembling a peach, which is placed on the back of three frogs on top of the gate to the temple. Passing through Đài Nghiên, visitors will tread on the wooden bridge called Thê Húc. Thê Húc is literally understood+as the place where beams of morning sunshine are touching; NGHI TÀM: A VILLAGE OF FLOWERS? Once upon a time, the King of Nhà Hậu Lý decided to build a palace for Princess Từ Hoa in a village near Thăng Long so that she could spend+her time farming silk cocoons on the large mulberry fields. The village was Nghi Tàm, a name now famous throughout the country for the flowers grown here. Nghi Tàm flowers in fact add to the beauty of Hồ Tây or the West Lake area in present-day Hà Nội. It is said that Nhà Hậu Lý in Vietnam was not only famous for its glorious victories in defence+of the country against foreign invaders. It paid much attention to the development of agriculture and handicrafts. For long, the village of Tằm (or the village of silk cocoons) had been known for its handlooms. The story of this village goes as follows: Initially, there were only three basic kinds of trees grown here, ịẹ the peach, kumquat and chrysanthemum. Peach trees and their spring blossom have brought fame to this village. Originally, the cultivation of peach started in the village of Tằm, then spread to Nhật Tân. Young peach trees are carefully tended and allowed to blossom only on the Lunar New Year's Eve. Hanoians take the utmost care in the selection of their New Year branch of peach From the size to the form of the branch and the design of the pot, every tiny detail must be in harmony with the sentiment or philosophy that one wishes to express, in addition to matching with the interior decoration of the house. Kumquat is another species that spread from Tằm village to Tây Hồ. During tết, most families in Hà Nội, and now throughout the country, have their kumquat trees inside the home. Kumquat is used by Vietnamese to symbolise ""talents"" and ""wealth"" for the family White apricot blossoms called ""Bạch mai"" in Vietnamese are yet another scene-stealer in Nghi Tàm. The villagers of Nghi Tàm consider an apricot blossom as beautiful only when it has six white soft petals on a green calyx. They must resemble the swallow's wings in the spring days. There is also a kind of green apricot which is rare and valuable. Then there is ""Song mai"" or ""Double apricot"" since each flower gives two fruits. The apricot branch should be able to incorporate the spirit. After the flowering season, the branch starts to give fruit which are washed and put in a ceramic cask to prepare apricot wine for the following New Year's festival. Narcissus of various kinds are also cultivated in Nghi Tàm. The people here know the secret of making these flowers bloom at the required time as on New Year's Eve or on the wedding day etc. Each narcissus pot should have about 20-30 flowers blooming to the right degree to express the virginity of the bride. Along with these species of flowers, Nghi Tàm is also known for the chrysanthemum and camelia species it grows. But the concern now is that with the rapid urbanisation of the locality, will it continue to preserve this beautiful tradition?

đũa	(noun) Pineapple, ananas; Pineapple plants are grown widely in the country. People in southern; Vietnam usually call this tropical fruit as Trai Thom (fragrant fruit) which is literally precise quote for the fruit because anyone who first takes a bite of the fruit can surely feel the strong sweet smell come to his or her nostrils. The good smell that lingers longer than that of some other fruits, makes connoisseurs find it hard to forget. Pineapple is processed for different products such as canned pineapple, pineapple liquor and sweet preserved pineapple. Growers press this fruit to get the juice which is then mixed with the yoke of a hen's egg before being stirred thoroughly to become a muddy drink. The drink is said to be very sweet, butterfly and nutritious

mơ	(noun) Wooden bell, bamboo tocsin; Village herald (belonging to the lowest social class, in former times); THE EXTRAORDINARY SOUNDS OF TOCSIN: Tocsin, drum and horn are familiar musical instruments in Vietnam's countryside. However, tocsin is the most versatile with its extraordinary sounds, depending on whether it is found: in the forest, where it is used as a musical instrument, in the village, as a warning signal, or in the pagoda where it is essential for Buddhist rituals. In the village watch towerm, there used to be many wooden fish clappers. Depending on the rhythm of the beating, the villagers could be informed of different events: Festivities, thieves, fire, or strengthening dikes. In the highlands, small wooden rattles are attached to the necks of buffaloes to help their owners distinguish their cattle. These tocsins are oval-shaped ones. Their lengths and thickness also differ. Hence the peculiar sounds made by the buffaloes. In the pagoda, Mo Qua is used to accompany the prayers of Buddhist bronzes. Tocsins are made from different materials Some are made from the roots of a bamboo tree (widely used by the village crier), or from the trunk of an old bamboo (used in the watch tower because of the strident sound it produces).+As a result of years of study, Ta Tham, an elderly musician, managed to develop a new musical instrument comprising a series of tocsins. Thus this concert is composed of four kinds of tocsin: Ong, Qua, Trac and Thanh, meaning respectively tube, fruit, teak and sound. Trac tocsins, made of hard wood (such as teak or steel wood) and placed to the left, can produce clear and light sounds.The musician can use tube tocsins and teak tocsins to reflect exclusive sounds hitherto unknown in all kinds of tocsin. They can mock the sounds made by woodpeckers, partridges, frogs, insects or horse hooves. Since the cluster of tocsins was born, it has become highly valued by many art troupes nationwide. It has been awarded a prize by the Institute of Music under the Ministry of Culture and Information

lắng	(noun) Village; Set, table (in a game), circles; FLOATING VILLAGES: Rearing fish in cages under rafts has become increasingly common in a number of countries, but perhaps nowhere is this occupation as advantageous as in Vietnam with its maze of rivers and streams criss-crossing the country from north to south, from west to east, totalling perhaps millions of kilometres in length.When it comes to raising fish in cages, AnGiang province in the Mekong River delta has always taken the lead. It has 40 to 50 years' experience, has the biggest number of cages and produces more caged fish than any other locality in the country. It is no exaggeration to say that the fishing rafts on AnGiang rivers are true floating villages.If you ever come to AnGiang, do not fail to visit Cồn Tiên where you can fully appreciate the poetic nature of such villages. They are made of large rafts of either bamboo or timber depending on the capabilities of the fish raisers. In most cases, they are timber rafts measuring about 12 by 5 metres and 3 metres in height. After five months -- the usual time for the fish to complete their life cycle -- the family of the fish raiser anchors the raft on some part of the Tiền, Hậu, or Châu Đốc rivers or any major canals. At present, most districts in AnGiang such as Long Xuyên, Châu Đốc, Chợ Mới, Phú Tân, Phú Châu and Châu Phú raise caged fish, but this occupation is still essentially practised in Cồn Tiên village, Châu Đốc township Cồn Tiên has the advantage of being located near the supply centre for young fish and fish meal (the Châu Đốc market) and also on a fast-flowing river. Cồn Tiên actually accounts for almost half of all the fish rafts of AnGiang provincẹThe two main fish species raised in cages in AnGiang are the Ba Sa and Chai which take their food from the water surface. Their food consists chiefly of rice bran mixed with vegetables such as pumpkin.A raft for rearing 50,000 Ba Sa fish needs about 3,500 kilograms of food, but for rearing 10,000 to 20,000 Chai, only 00 to 800 kilos of food are required. One raft needs only three workhands. The first harvest from a raft averages 12 tonnes of Ba Sa and three tonnes of he or Chai fish.+Net profit may account for 25 % - 30 % of the proceeds. But not everything has been plain sailing for the fish raisers of AnGiang. At its peak year, AnGiang had 1,200 rafts. In 1971, there were only 662 and the number slumped to 225 in 1980. A rapid recovery began in 1984, when the local government decreed new policies on prices and on the rearing and marketing of caged fish. Early in 1990, the AnGiang Aquatic Produce Import- Export Company loaned fish raisers three billion dong. It also found markets for caged fish in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Subsequently, the number of rafts rose to 715 and fish output to 14,000 tonnes, double the figures for 1989. The expansion also provided jobs for 4,000 people. One of the biggest problems in caged fish raising in AnGiang is the supply of young fish, since most of them come from natural breeding. Production of all other fish still depends on natural breeding. Research and experimentation in this direction with regard to fish such as Ba Sa, Chai and Bong are going on at the provincial sciences committee. In recent years, caged fish raising has also been undertaken by other provinces such as Hà Tây, Hà Bắc and Vĩnh Phú in the north and Hậu Giang, Đồng Tháp and Long An in the south. In Hà Tây province west of Hà Nội, 200 families in the district of Ba Vì, Dan Phương and Mỹ Đức keep more than 200 fish cages along the Đà and Red Rivers. Ba Vì district alone has 165 cages, mainly raising Indian carp. They yield from two to three tonnes of fish per cage. On average, the fish raisers get from 16 to 24 million dong in income and about seven million in net profit. Riverside villages such as Thuan My, Tay Dang, Co Do and Minh Châu are gradually shifting from fishing in the river to raising fish in cages. The administration in Ba Vì has made a uniform loan of one million dong to every family of fish raisers. Experts are providing technical assistance to make fish spawn in the rivers, thus reducing production costs. Many families of farmers are also raising fish as a secondary occupation besides cultivation. One thousand families of farmers in Ba Vì district have registered for caged fish raising

Ha Tinh	Hà Tĩnh is situated 340km from Hà Nội. Đồng Lộc is the meeting place of the two provincial roads 5 and 15 in the hilly area of Hà Tĩnh province. During the anti-US war, Đồng Lộc Forked Road was the main junction of the supply line from the North to Hồ Chí Minh Trail. US aircraft concentrated a great number of bombs and ammunitions in repeated efforts to destroy the junction and the surrounding area. This less than 0-km section of road had to undergo 2,057 bombardments. A memorable place is the native village of the great poet Nguyễn Du. Nguyễn Du was born in 1765 from a family of scholars and illustrious mandarins. Having successfully passed the provincial examinations at the age of nineteen, he served as military mandarin under Lê Cảnh Hưng. In 1789, Nguyễn Huệ (emperor Quang Trung) made a northward advance and drove 290,000 Qing invaders out of the country. King Lê Chiêu Thống cowardly fled the country and followed the invaders. After the fall of the Lê Dynasty, Nguyễn Du refused to serve Nguyễn Huệ. Instead, he chose to live in poverty for 10 years in his wife's native village in Thái Bình province In 1802, Nguyễn Du grudgingly accepted service under Gia Long, the founder of Nhà Nguyễn (Nguyễn Dynasty). However, in his heart, he did not like mandarin work and applied for retirement no less than three times, each time in vain. He was named Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Rites. In 1820, he died in the royal capital of Huế. His most famous work is Kiều Story, a narrative in 3,254 verses. With this work, Nguyễn Du stands out as the greatest poet Vietnam has ever produced There is a house in commemoration of Nguyễn Du in Tiên Điền village. About one kilometre from the house is his tomb

Thanh Hoa	Thanh Hoá is a large province of Central Vietnam. Thanh Hoá is composed of three categories of mountain, plain and mid-land terrains. Its coastline is 102km in length. Being the dwelling place of the ancient Viets, Thanh Hoa is proud of the glorious Đông Sơn culture (see also Các Nền Văn Hoá ở Việt Nam). Only 16 km from Thanh Hoá City, Sầm Sơn Beach is very good for bathing. Beside sandy beaches, Sầm Sơn also has some scenic spots such as Trong Mai Island, Doc Cuoc Temple and Co Tien Mount. Citadel of the Hồ Dynasty (Thành Nhà Hồ) was built in 1397. It was not only the location for the central government, but also a quite military project. All the ancient citadels in Vietnam such as the citadels of Hoa Lư and Cổ Loa were made of earth, the only exception being the Hồ Dynasty Citadel, which was wholly built in block granite, depicting the power of creativeness and industriousness of the labouring people more than six centuries ago. The Hồ Citadel Dynasty only existed for 10 years (1397-1407), but its vestiges are still surprising because many of its technical questions remain the unknowns; Bà Triệu (Lady Trieu) Temple is located at the foot of the Tùng mountain (Triệu Lộc commune, Thanh Hoá province). This mountain was the centre of the insurrection led by her. Bà Triệu whose full name was Triệu Thị Trinh was a beloved national heroine. She led the nation in an uprising against the northern invasion in the 3rd century. Ritual ceremonies are held yearly at the temple on the 21st day of the lunar second month. People on pilgrimage to the temple often recall Bà Triệu s outright declaration: ""I want to drive over strong wind, sail over strong waves and chase the foreign invaders out of the country, and I will not give up myself to be their servant-concubine"". Mã River is the largest one in Thanh Hoá. Nearing the coast, the river meets a high mountain which resembles a dragon's head, from which the bridge spanning that part of river derives its name. In the early 20th century, French engineers tried in vain to built an iron bridge over Mã River. In 1905, they completed a suspension bridge only to see it destroyed in the anti-French war. When peace returned in 1954, Vietnamese engineers applied new engineering techniques and built an iron bridge. The new Hàm Rồng bridge was completed on May 19, 1964. The bridge gained fame because it became the main target of US air forces in the efforts to break the North-South supply lines

Chu Van An	Chu Văn An (1292-1370) - talented and virtuous pedagogue and scholar in the Trần times - was reputed for straightforwardness and not being concerned with fame and advantages. His native village was in Thanh Đạm (Thanh Trì- Hà Nội). He graduated as doctor and came home to teach instead of becoming a mandarin. Many of his students make their way in the world (Phạm Sư Mạnh, Lê Quát). Chu Văn An taught the crown prince at Quốc Tử Giám, and submitted Thất Trảm Sớ (petition asking to behead seven sycophantic mandarins) to the king. Because the king's disapproval, he resigned and led a secluded life under the pen-name Tiều Ân (secluded woodcutter). His works were Quốc Ngữ Thi Tập (Anthology of national language), Tiều Ân Thi Tập (Anthology of a secluded woodcutter). There is a temple to his memory at the Temple of Literature in Hà Nội; CHU VĂN AN: LIFE AND TIMES. Chu Văn An died over six centuries ago, in the year 1370, but the example he set as a great patriot and teacher will remain engraved in the hearts of our people. Having won the degree of Thái Học Sinh (doctorate) in the official literary examinations, he refused to be appointed a mandarin official at the royal court and instead opened a school to train the country's scholars. Many of his more talented students would later go on to pursue successful careers. Two of his students, Phạm Sư Mạnh and Lê Quát, rose to the position of prime minister. In the reign of Trần Minh Tôn, Chu Văn An was invited to teach at Quốc Tử Giám, the National University in the capital city of Thăng Long (now Hà Nội), attended by the most talented scholars as well as the sons of high dignitaries, including the prince heir to the throne. He was the author of many books: Collections of poems in both the vernacular and classical Chinese, dissertations on Confucian classics, and a treaty on traditional medicine The vestiges of his life and career, carefully preserved by the people in spite of the ravages of war and the passage of time, testify to the great respect in which his memory is held. Thanh Liệt commune in Thanh Trì district south of Hà Nội is believed to be the birth place of his mother, Lê Thị Chiêm. In the communal house are kept a record of his life and a couplet praising his virtues and achievements. A shrine was also built in 1846, dedicated to him and to a remarkable man among his descendants, Doctor Chu Đinh Bang, who lived in the reign of Lê Thánh Tôn (15th century) In Tam Hiệp commune, Thanh Trì district is found Hùynh Cung Temple, built on the site of a famous school founded by Chu Văn An. In Văn Điển south of Hà Nội is a stone stele with an inscription honouring Chu Văn An, erected in 1803. But the most important national institutions related to his life and career are the Temple of Literature (Văn Miếu) and the National University (Quốc Tử Giám) in Hà Nội. Here the Trần kings erected an altar to honour him alongside those dedicated to Confucius and his 72 disciples. Also in Hà Nội, a tree-lined street and a secondary school, the most renowned in the country, are named after him. In Hải Hưng province are found vestiges related to the later years of his life. Here he lived as a recluse for ten years after unsuccessfully petitioning the king for the death sentence to seven corrupt high-ranking dignitaries. The commune where he spent those years is now named after him. It is located in Chí Linh district near a beautiful range of hills called Phượng Sơn (Phoenix Mount). His remains were buried there

nộm	(noun) Chinese-transcribed Vietnamese
nộm	(adj) Prose-like, simple, easy to understand; In opposition to the Chinese's Hán language, Nôm (slantingly pronounced from ""Nam"") language belonged to Việt ethnic group. It borrowed the Hán hieroglyphic scripts to transcribe the Vietnamese language. Nôm language might appear in the 8th century. The memorable poems in Nôm language belonged to Hàn Thuyên and Nguyễn Sĩ Cố (in the late 13th century) The birth of Nôm language not only marked the Việt people's mature national consciousness, but also brought a brilliant development to the Vietnamese literature between the late 18th and early 19th centuries. For complication and imperfection, Nôm language was replaced by quốc ngữ (national language)

vú sữa	(noun) Star apple; Upon entering an orchard of star apple trees, visitors can see for themselves hundreds of star apples hanging suspendedly from branches. The round and smooth fruits are of the same size. The shape of the star apple only may as well match the name attached to it let alone its juice as fragrantly sweet, purely white as the milk from the breast. When using the knife to cut the fruit, it is advisable to cut the fruit into two parts before using a spoon to take out the pulp bit by bit until nothing is left. The most appreciated way to enjoy this fruit is to drill a small hole at its top and lift it to the mouth and raise the head backward to suck the flow of the fragrant juice into the mouth continuously as if a baby sucking milk from its mother's breast. Don't forget to squeeze the tough fruit for a while until it becomes tendered so that the juice can mix with the pulp of the fruit to become a sweet and fragrant muddy substance that looks like milk from the breast

văn học	(noun) Literature; Vietnamese literature was developed at an early date. It includes two major components which have developed simultaneously and are profoundly interrelated: Folk literature and written literature. Vietnamese folk literature came into being very early and had a profound effect on the spiritual life of the Viets. The folk literature always praised beauty, humanism, love of godness, and contributed to the formation of a national sense. Legends, fairy tales, humorous stories, folk songs, epics... have a tremendous vitality and have lived on today. Written literature first appeared around the 10th century. It had a leading role and bore the main traits of Vietnamese literature. From the 10th to the 15th century, literary works were written in Han (classical Chinese) and Chu Nom. But since the 16th century, Chu Nom literature became increasingly popular, and held a prime position by the early 18th century. Well-known works written in Chu Nom included Chinh Phu Ngam by female poet Doan Thi Diem, Kieu Story by Nguyen Du and the Chu Nom poems of female poet Ho Xuan Huong. These works were the cream of Vietnamese literature. In the 20's, the country's literature was written in Vietnamese Quoc Ngu (Romanized national language). In that period, the country saw drastic changes in its socio-economic structure and cultural life and began to experience the far-reaching influence of Western culture. Vietnamese literature thereby developed quickly in terms of quantity, genre and form. Prominent in prose were Tat Den by Ngo Tat To, Bi Vo by Nguyen Hong, Buoc Duong Cung and short stories by Nguyen Cong Hoan, short stories by Nam Cao, Giong To and other novels by Vu Trong Phung. Poetry also developed vigorously, culminating in the new poetry movement with a generation of famous authors such as: The Lu, Pham Huy Thong, Xuan Dieu, Luu Trong Lu, Huy Can... Traditionally, Vietnamese literature always featured patriotism, national pride and humanism. It was not by chance that great cultural personalities such as Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du were also humanists

Duy Tan	King Duy Tân (ruler from 1907 to 1916) whose name at birth was Vĩnh San was considered the mastermind behind the patriotic armed insurrection led by Thái Phiên, Trần Cao Vân and many other patriots. The insurrection, however, was soon discovered and crushed and all participants were killed. Only King Duy Tân was exiled to the Reunion island in the Indian Ocean. The king was released from jail only to be dragged into a re-invasion scheme of Vietnam after the World War II. He was fired at in a suspicious air-crack in Middle-Africa on Christmas day of 1945 as his ""Absolute Independence policy"" was not in line with the colonial aspirations of General De Gaulle. Unfortunately, the patriotic king was misunderstood by most Vietnamese people due to his unclear relation with General De Gaulle. By the 1960s, Vietnamese and French researchers brought to light the relation between king Duy Tân and General De Gaulle, proving the unchanging patriotic will of the king. In 942, from the jail island Reunion, listening for the first time to the anti-fascism appeal of General De Gaulle broadcast from Britain, king Duy Tân showed a deep respect and admiration for him. He then founded a war-resistant group operating for the ally- France. With a self-made radio, he recorded and transmitted information to the French Liberation Force against the pro-Germany government at VichỵWhen Reunion island was liberated by the French Liberation Force, he voluntarily enrolled as a Radio maitre aboard the ship Leopard. In March 1945, France was liberated. By the end of the year, subsequent to the abdication of king Bảo Đại in Vietnam, De Gaulle arranged for 100 parachute commandos in Sài Gòn to prepare for the setting up of a dynasty headed by king Duy Tân.But Vĩnh San (king Duy Tân) knew nothing about this secret scheme. He vigorously believed that the French hero De Gaulle would help him bring peace, re-unification, and complete independence to his home country, Vietnam.+Additionally, he was opposed to the plan of ascending the throne . His political viewpoint was sharply contested and led him to become pessimistic. On December 17, 1945, he predicted his death to his friend and immediately wrote a political statement to express his belief in struggling for the unification of the north, centre and the south of Vietnam. As predicted, the event of his death took place eight days later His statement was veiled in secrecy until 1947 when the Combat newspaper copied and ran it. This delay in publicizing the facts surrounding his death and the nature of his true intentions for planning for a unified Vietnam made him misunderstood by the people of Vietnam. In reality, this patriot deserves the respect of all the peoplẹIn April 1987, thanks to the joint assistance of the governments of Vietnam and France, the king's remains were moved by his relatives to Vietnam and set down next to the royal mausoleums of King Dục Đức (his grandfather) and King Thành Thái (his father) in the central city of Huế
Duy Tan	King Duy Tân (ruler from 1907 to 1916) whose name at birth was Vĩnh San was considered the mastermind behind the patriotic armed insurrection led by Thái Phiên, Trần Cao Vân and many other patriots. The insurrection, however, was soon discovered and crushed and all participants were killed. Only King Duy Tân was exiled to the Reunion island in the Indian Ocean. The king was released from jail only to be dragged into a re-invasion scheme of Vietnam after the World War II. He was fired at in a suspicious air-crack in Middle-Africa on Christmas day of 1945 as his ""Absolute Independence policy"" was not in line with the colonial aspirations of General De Gaulle. Unfortunately, the patriotic king was misunderstood by most Vietnamese people due to his unclear relation with General De Gaulle.

pho	(noun) Noodle soup; Phở is the most popular food among the population. Phở is mostly commonly eaten for breakfast, although many other people would have it for their lunch or dinner. Anyone feeling hungry in the small hours of the morning can also enjoy a bowl of hot and spicy Phở to fill their empty stomach. Phở also needs its special taste and smell. The grated rice paper is made of the best variety of fragrant rice called Gạo Tẻ. The soup for Phở Bò (Phở with beef) is made by stewing the bones of cows and pigs for a long time in a large pot. Pieces of fillet mignon together with several slices of ginger are reserved for a bowl of Phở Bò Tái (rare fillet). Slices of well done meat are however offered to those less keen on eating rare fillets. Meanwhile soup for Phở Gà (Phở with chicken meat) is made by stewing together chicken and pig bones. White chicken meat served with Phở Gà is boneless and cut into thin slices You could regard Phở Bò and Phở Gà as Vietnam's special soup. It has the added advantage of being convenient to prepare and healthy to eat

dan bau	(noun) Monochord; đàn bầu (monochord): Đàn bầu consists of a long piece of wood, on which is stretched a silk or brass string, which is fastened at one end to a peg and at the other to a flexible bamboo plate. The string is passed repeatedly through an open dried gourd as sound box. Although having only one string, it can emit all the sounds in the pentatonic scale. The eight notes of Vietnamese music give modulations of greater amplitudes than those obtained by any other single-stringed instrument in the world. Today, Đàn bầu is made very carefully to ensure aesthetic and sound quality. When played in public, it is often used with an electronic amplifier

Mường	dân tộc Mường; With about 800,000 inhabitants, Mường ethnic group occupies 1.3% of the Vietnamese population. The Mường people's residential sphere set up an arc between the Vietnamese from Vĩnh Phú to west of Hoà Bình, then to midlands of Nghệ An and Thanh Hoá. They belong to Việt-Mường linguistic group, but their culture is closer to Thái ethnic group. They live on growing rice, breeding, forging. Their residential area houses Hoà Bình Culture of the neolithic era along with which rice-growing appeared over 8,000 years BC Khua Luong (""Beating the mortar"" in the Mường dialect) is a game played with wooden instruments by the Mường ethnic group, who settled in northern Vietnam in the early days of the nation's historỵThe instruments of this game consist simply of mortars and pestles, all made of wood Mortars and pestles are very familiar items of use in the life of the Mường community. They are used to husk rice before it is cooked, or to crush lean meat to make giò, bánh giày, and so on. Thus the sound of the pestle and mortar is very familiar to the Mường women. Gradually, it came to be used as a musical instrument producing familiar sounds and rhythms. Through generations, this musical instrument has known many refinements and finally was used as an instrument for a concert by both young people and the old people in the village. This musical instrument dates back many thousands of years and has been preserved to date as a precious tradition among the Mường ethnic group. It might have come into existence long before the Việt community knew how to melt copper to make bronze drums and bronze bells for musical instruments.=Nowadays, among the Mường community at Thường Xuân, Thanh Hoá+province, there exist many Khua luong teams each comprising six to eight young girls. They can play up to 12 traditional concerts reflecting the landscape and the atmosphere of the Bản Mường (Mường villages)as well as the feelings of the people there. The most typical of the concerts are those depicting ""a wedding party in the village"", a scene of "" Welcoming Guests"", of ""Waiting for the Bride"" and of the wedding ceremony itself. In the ""Welcoming Guests"" item, a merry atmosphere is created through the sounds of pestle and mortar as the people busy themselves with husking rice and making cake to entertain the guests. In the ""Waiting for the Bride"" concert, there reigns an atmosphere of impatient longing for the bride. In the ""Wedding Party"", the stately sounds help people to get rid of the noisy crowd and enter a world of quiet felicity as the bride and groom gather under the cosy roof of their new house. Besides the four main concerts, there are some others such as ""Welcoming New Rice"", the ""Early Rains"", ""Hymn to the Genie of Thunder"". It is hard to imagine the perfection of the sounds and music unless you attend one of the ceremonies where khua luong concerts are performed. The music leaves a deep impression on the audience and, at times, tugs at the heartstrings

This musical instrument dates back many thousands of years and has been preserved to date as a precious tradition among the Mường ethnic group. It might have come into existence long before the Việt community knew how to melt copper to make bronze drums and bronze bells for musical instruments.=Nowadays, among the Mường community at Thường Xuân, Thanh Hoá+province, there exist many Khua luong teams each comprising six to eight young girls. They can play up to 12 traditional concerts reflecting the landscape and the atmosphere of the Bản Mường (Mường villages)as well as the feelings of the people there. The most typical of the concerts are those depicting ""a wedding party in the village"", a scene of "" Welcoming Guests"", of ""Waiting for the Bride"" and of the wedding ceremony itself. In the ""Welcoming Guests"" item, a merry atmosphere is created through the sounds of pestle and mortar as the people busy themselves with husking rice and making cake to entertain the guests. In the ""Waiting for the Bride"" concert, there reigns an atmosphere of impatient longing for the bride. In the ""Wedding Party"", the stately sounds help people to get rid of the noisy crowd and enter a world of quiet felicity as the bride and groom gather under the cosy roof of their new house. Besides the four main concerts, there are some others such as ""Welcoming New Rice"", the ""Early Rains"", ""Hymn to the Genie of Thunder"". It is hard to imagine the perfection of the sounds and music unless you attend one of the ceremonies where khua luong concerts are performed. The music leaves a deep impression on the audience and, at times, tugs at the heartstrings

rượu cần	Rượu cần (wine drunk out of a jar through pipes) is very popular among the highlanders, especially in Tây Nguyên. But its flavour differs from one area to another. In Sơn La (some 300 km north-west of Hà Nội), for example, where the Thái ethnic groups are to be found, people drink rượu cần in their own special way. It is drunk on several occasions: Tết festival, wedding parties, ground-breaking ceremonies or other festive days. The jar containing the wine is put at a fixed place (in the middle of the house or the yard), so that as many people as possible can drink it. Pipes are put into the jar prior to drinking and a basinful of pure water is placed beside it. A buffalo horn to be used to pour water into the jar is put on a tray nearby. Not everyone is allowed to drink rượu cần. And the order of precedence is strictly observed. But there is no racial discrimination: the Kinh ( Việt) may drink with the Thái and Mường. The ingredients of rượu cần include wild leaves, cassava roots and rice which are washed and put above an oven for 20 days or sọ Then all the mixed ingredients are wrapped with large banana leaves and left in a corner of the house for a couple of days. As soon as the process of fermentation is completed, the whole brew is put into a jar. When all the guests are seated, the host pours water from the basin into the jar. At first, he invites the guests to taste the wine from a jar whose wine is more bitter than others. This is meant to remind everyone of the bitterness of life. Then a second jar is brought in which the wine tastes more pungent. In the third jar, the wine is sweetest symbolizing that "" your heart can be happy after so much grief"". Drinking rượu cần is accompanied by Múa Xoè (a dance of the Thái ethnic minorities) and drum beating. All this is to help the host and guests forget all their daily worries and enjoy to the utmost the pleasure of tasting rượu cần. (VNS)

lịch sử	(noun) History; Vietnam's history from an early age is a national history characterised by uninterrupted struggles against foreign invaders. The Northern Kingdom's Domination lasted one thousand years. This was one of the fiercest trials and periods of hardship in Vietnam's history of national development of the different tribal peoples inhabiting Vietnamese soil. However, the Viet people managed to maintain their particular cultural identity. Such revolts which were led by Hai Bà Trưng (the two Trung ladies), Bà Triệu (Lady Trieu), and Lý Nam Đế and especially the historic victory at the Bạch Đằng river in 938, under the leadership of Ngô Quyền which finally led the Vietnamese people to a complete victory and they regained their national independence. National Construction and Defence for National Independence lasted about one thousand years (from the early 10th Century to the middle of the 19th Century). This period also witnessed several fierce struggles launched by the Vietnamese people against the northern aggressors. The wars of resistance included the battle against the Tống army in the 11th century, three separate wars against the invading Mongol army in the 13rd century, and the resistance against the Minh army in the 14th century. In the late 17th century, the Vietnamese feudal nation was faced with a social and economic crisis that led to an annexation of the country into two parts. However, the victory of the Tây Sơn revolt at the close of the 18th century reunified the country. In the first half of the 19th century, the Nguyễn dynasty continued to consolidate national unification. Yet, a prevailing conservative attitude among Nguyễn dynasty court officials allowed the country to drift into a period of stagnation and Vietnam eventually became a French colony. At present, the Vietnamese people are trying to develop their national economy in a very difficult situation mostly due to the dictatorship of the Vietnamese communist goverment. Now, let's have a chronological summary on Vietnamese history:; In the ancient times, Red River Civilization succeeded the native prehistoric cultures. At its apogee, the ancient Viet people's first nations (Văn Lang, Âu Lạc) appeared; Thời Bắc Thuộc (Period of Chinese domination) lasted 1117 years between 179BC and 938; Các quốc gia phong kiến độc lập (Independent feudal nations)
lịch sử	(Thời Cận Đại (Modern times)+</b><ul></ul></div>; <div><b>Thời Hiện Đại (Present times)) Incontestably, Phong Trào Yêu Nước (Patriotic movements) always feature the heroic Vietnamese history. To have an overview of the Vietnamese culture, see also Các Nền Văn Hoá Ỗ Việt Nam; Restoration of cultural and historical monuments in Vietnam: Vietnam has 979 classified national monuments relics including 497 historical monuments, 440 ancient architectures (pagodas, temples and communal houses), 30 scenic places and 12 archaeological sites. Thirty years of war have inflicted serious damage on these monuments. Some have been almost completely destroyed like the old citadel at Quảng Trị in Central Vietnam. Others were heavily damaged such as many temples, pagodas, churches and other places of worship in northern Vietnam Nature has also taken its toll. Conservation work has been compounded by growing appropriation of public lands by people for house construction, especially in the towns The government has taken positive steps in recent years to restore some of the most significant historical relies like the old capital in Huế, central Vietnam, Cổ Loa Citadel, the first capital of Vietnam, the ancient capital of Hoa Lư in Nam Hà province, or the temples of the Hùng Kings, founders of the Vietnamese nation nearly 4,000 years ago. Conservationists are all interested in preserving original features. They have received helpful assistance in expertise from many countries, like Poland's assistance in the restoration of Chăm towers in Central Vietnam, assistance from UNESCO and Japan in the restoration of old Huế and Hội An and German assistance in the restoration of Bút Tháp Pagoda in Hà Bắc provincẹOne major problem is the destruction caused by termites to iron-wood pillars in temples and pagodas. Vietnamese restorers have found a solution by drawing upon the experience of builders in the past. A common method is either to fill hollowed-out pillars with concrete or to replace them with new ones. But both have their drawbacks. In the first case, the concrete would detach from the wood within a few years. In the latter case, the cost involved and the risk of collapse during the replacement would be high.To solve the problem, Vietnamese restorers have combined the use of traditional termite killers with the spraying of chemicals into the infested pillars. That would both kill the insects and prevent the growth of fungi. They can gnaw away each year from 0.2mm to.5mm of wood. But what is more damaging is that the humid secretion they leave on the surface will create the necessary environment for the development of fungi. This damage can be best seen at Keo Pagoda in Thái Bình province, 100 km southeast of Hà Nội, where several hundred iron-wood pillars have been virtually eaten up.=Recent years in Hà Nội have seen the restoration of many pagodas and temples thanks to contributions in money and manpower from the population Since 1991, the local authorities have spent dozens of millions of dong on repairing the Temple of Literature, the first national university where 82 stone stelas can be found on which the names of 1,234 laureates of successive examinations in the feudal times are recorded. Cost of the whole project is estimated at 12 billion dong, or about 1 million dollars.Work is also going on for the renovation of ancient constructions on and around the Gươm Lake in the centre of the capital city

Nhà Hậu Lê	Nhà Hậu Lê (Post-Lê Dynasty) was founded by Lê Thái Tổ after the resounding victory over the Ming invaders. Our country was Đại Việt with Đông Kinh (Hà Nội) as royal capital. The feudal centralism had the despotic trends, especially in the second half of the 15th century The economic, political, military, educational and cultural fields were considerably developed. Đại Việt became the powerful nation in Southeast Asia. Confucianism held a more and more important position, while the literature reached the apogee under the reign of Lê Thánh Tôn. Đại Việt defeated Chăm Pa, occupied its royal city and set up the Quảng Nam administrative division. Because of the ruling class' immoderate luxury, Post-Lê Dynasty began to decline since the 17th century. Competition for power between warlords and peasant insurrections broke out everywhere. In 1527, Nhà Mạc (Mạc Dynasty) usurped Nhà Hậu Lệ Under the pretext of restoring Nhà Hậu Lê, Lords Nguyễn and Trịnh sought ways for suppressing Nhà Mạc. Between 1533 and 1788 was the period when Lê passed through renaissance and decline

Thousands of diverse musical tunes have been collected from this source. From Quan Ho folk songs in the North to Hue songs (songs from the Perfume River), ""guessing game"" songs, satirical songs, joking songs and numerous songs in southern provinces, all are characterised by a profound sensibility and poetic, lyrical sense. After 1945, royal court music was underdeveloped. But folk music flourished more than ever before along with the increasingly popular modern music

quần áo	(noun) Clothing, clothes; The land of Vietnam is not large, but it incorporates over 50 ethnic groups. Except for the Kinh or Việt people living throughout the country's plains and occupying the majority, others find their place on the hilly and mountainous areas and are preserving their very own cultures and dressing patterns. A costume contest for all ethnicities in Vietnam, if organised, would for sure be very much interesting.What excites people most could be the both primitive and modern costumes of some groups like the Gia Rai. Women of this group wear nothing but a small skirt. Men would take just a loin-cloth to go on any occasion. Certainly, this is much more sexy than any modern fashions in the West! On the other hand, many others are dressing quite complicatedly. The H'Mông girls for instance would wear a shirt, undergarments, leggings and put on a coiled scarf on their head. Their skirts are usually in cone shape with lots of folds that enhance their gentleness. And it is not less exciting to watch them dance, making the folds wide open. The dressing pattern of each ethnic group reflects their culture, history and conceptions. It also shows their life style and working conditions as well. Also, each subgroup also has its distinction from the rest of the same minority. Take the Tày, Thái, Mường, Dao for example. The traditional Tày's costume for girls is a kerchief tied in a triangle on the forehead, simple indigo dress, belt and silver bracelets and chains. A Mường girl usually wears a medium length skirt, short white shirt and a pair of silver earrings The Thái girls are different. They would wear a colourful scarf, short jacket with silver buttons in two lines and a tight black skirt. The silver buttons and shining decorations look like budding bauhinia blossoms. People of the subgroups in the Dao minority share many similarities while at the same time are a little bit distinct from each other. Girls in the Dao Đỏ (Red Dao) keep their hair long and fold them around their heads covered with a red cloth. They wear indigo dress embroiled with decorations in red. It is understandable that these people wear what suit their way of living and the climate they are in. But at the same time, they also know how to produce cloths, embroideries etc. to make their very own dress. One of the speciality they produce is brocade which has become quite famous and made a worthy export product. Nowadays, their traditional dresses have changed to some extend due to cultural interactions with other minorities and the Viet majority. This trend has been shown most obviously in those groups living near the plains where the Việt people are present. The culture of the Việt which forms the majority of their population greatly influences other minorities' cultures. Theoretically, this is a normal phenomena. In the last 10 years, thanks to the renovation process in the country, the pace of cultural, economic interactions among all ethnic groups have been increasing considerably. The process of rapid urbanisation can be found now even in hilly areas. As such, traditional and ethnic cultural activities experience deep changes both for the better and the worse. In some regions, it is now a little difficult to find a youth wearing his/her traditional costume. Although the middle-aged are still keeping with traditions like those in Thanh Hoá or Hoà Bình, it seems many of them have been 'Vietnamised'. The farther they stay from the plains, the more they could keep their dressing, patterns and traditions. It is something worth thinking of when there is a clash between traditional characteristics and a modern life style. Many among them have shifted from skirts and loin-cloths to jeans and plants plus a Western style shirt though the things they are wearing are local made and not quite in vogue The new way of dressing has been introduced to these remote areas by local civil workers who have had chances to go down to the country's urban areas or by teachers sent from such places. In many places, traditional dress is still overwhelming modern new one. With increasing awareness, ethnic people are trying to preserve their dressing patterns in a modern society, combining them to make new designs. This proves to be a good trend worth studying. Modernity does not always coincides with beauty. Fashion development should incorporate both cultural traditions and modern life For these ethnic people, there would be no traditional festivals held if their traditional dresses were dropped out. There would be no more cloth ball contests of the Thái if these people wear fashion wears. Many Vietnamese as well as foreign tourists have found themselves infatuated by the rượu cần (wine pot to be drunk together) and the Thái girls' dance in their on-stilts houses. The guests would fly with the dance rhythms. And that is what is attracting tourists to Mai Châu (Hoà Bình province)

nong nghiep	(noun) Agriculture, farming; CEREMONIES STILL AT THE HEART OF AGRICULTURE IN VIETNAM: Lễ Hạ Điền is a popular ceremony which bears a religious significance for Vietnamese farmers. During the ceremony, farmers pray to heaven to grant them blessings. As Vietnam is an agricultural country where labour-intensive wet-rice is grown, the life of the majority of people is closely linked with the land. Hence, almost all ceremonies and rituals are connected with farming. Wet-rice is grown in very difficult natural conditions, especially in the Red River Delta and central Vietnam where natural calamities - typhoons, flooding, drought and pests - are a constant menace for the peasantry. In the past, in the absence of science and technology, Vietnamese farmers believed in mysterious forces which decided their success or failure. This faith is found in such folk songs as ""Thanks to heaven which grants us good weather conditions"" or ""I pray to heaven to bring rain so that I can have enough water to drink and cover my fields"". Heaven (or Trời in Vietnamese) is a common appellation for the spirit world. The belief in the power of spirits is handed down from generation to generation, so that even now our farmers turn to spirits for assistance. Hence the existence of so many farming-related ceremonies. In the past, there were two main rice crops: the Mùa and the Chiêm Depending on climate and local understanding, farmers regard the Chiêm as the main crop, or vice versa. For this reason, Lễ Hạ Điền differs from one region to another. In many villages, the ceremony is regarded as a major event in the life of the peasantry. Although the ceremonies may differ in scale, the rituals have many common features. On the day of the ceremony, early in the morning, village notables called Già Làng (elder people) in the central highlands make their way to the communal house where other villagers await. There they pay tribute to Thành Hoàng (tutelary god) and Thần Nông (god of agriculture) and other divinities; begging them to bring security, prosperity and bumper crops. Afterwards, the villagers head to a chosen location, usually not too far from the communal house, where the ceremony inaugurating the farming season takes place. In a first-class rice field already meticulously ploughed and harrowed, a bamboo tree is planted with all its branches and leaves. The tree is called Cây Ne^u. Ears of rice are attached to the top of the tree, and having reported to the god of agriculture, they start the ceremony proper. To start the ball rolling, a rice transplant ritual is performed. For this, many Chúa Đồng (Field Lords) are selected. In some villages, only one Chúa Đồng is singled out. They are mostly elderly people, versed in farming techniques and the soil. In addition, they must be kind-hearted people having extended families whose members live in perfect concord. Last but not least, they should not be mourning People hope that the good qualities of the Chúa Đồng will blend into the rice plants and impart great vitality to them. Having paid their respects to the god of agriculture, the Chúa Đồng step into the field and transplant rice around the bamboo tree. In the meantime, the villagers shout cheerfully and beat drums (mimicking natural disaster), targeting the Chúa Đồng. If these people can stand firm on their feet and manage to perform their task well, people believe that their wish will come true Lễ Hạ Điền is held in a very simple way, but it is very dear to the farmers. They pin all their hopes on the good health, prosperity and happiness that the ceremony promises. Furthermore, it is in this ceremony that the spirit of the community comes to the surface. In their hearts, everyone pledges to join forces for the common cause

Cham	dân tộc Chăm; With about 100,000 inhabitants, Chăm (Chàm, Chiêm, Hời) ethnic group originates from Ancient Chăm Pa Kingdom. They live mainly in Ninh Thuận, Bình Thuận, Bình Định, Phú Yên. Belonging to Mã Lai-Đa Đảo linguistic group, the Chăm people remains influenced by matriarchy and Indian culture. The ancient Chăm writing is Sanskrit-based. Hinduism+and Mohammedanism are their principal religions; THE UNIQUE CHĂM CULTURE: The Chăm culture is a unique tradition, contributing much to the+diversity and richness of the Vietnamese multi-ethnic culture. From the first century AD, the Chăm people received deep influences from Indian culture. In the 7th century AD, Chăm Pa was already a kingdom with a capital in Trà Kiệu (now Quảng Nam) with a temple dedicated to the Indian Valmiki and his famous epic, the Ramayana By the middle of the 8th century AD, their capital was shifted to Nha Trang and five years later to Đông Dương, 15 km away from Trà Kiệu in the southeast.; The Chăm are one of the 53 ethnic groups in Vietnam and comprise various subgroups. There are around 98,000 Chăm people, including the Chăm Hroi in Bình Định, Phú Yên and those living in Ninh Thuận, Bình Thuận and other parts of southern Vietnam Inhabiting a large area, the Chăm also have many diversified customs and social practices. While most of the Chăm in Saigon, AnGiang and Tây Ninh, and the Chăm from Cambodia follow Islam, those living in Bình Thuận, Ninh Thuận provinces follow Brahmanism. Islam is modified to suit the people here and is called 'Baní. The Chăm language is of the+Malayo-Polynesian family and is spoken by about 250,000 people (G Moussay, Dictionaire Cham-Vietnamien-Francais, published by Phan Rang Culture Centre 1971). However, it does not necessarily follow that the Chăm in different regions can fully understand each other. It is natural that the Chăm borrow local words and expressions at the place they reside, mainly from Khơ Me and Vietnamese. In terms of their script, only the Cham Dong (in Bình Thuận, Ninh Thuận provinces) have preserved their original script. The Chăm script is now being taught at elementary school to help maintain this unique linguistic tradition. The Chăm also+utilised the Akhar Thrah scripts from Nam An which has been incorporated into present-day Chăm scripts. Ancient texts written on papyrus or paper+used both of these scripts and include various epics and love stories such as the Devamuno Inra Patra, Ummurup, Cambini, Bini-Cam, Sah Pakei, Patauw Kamai, Patauw adat Likei etc. This ancient literature gives a clear picture of the life and society of the Chăm through history. Together with academic literature, the Chăm also have very rich popular literature+which comprises hundreds of stories, sayings, idioms, puzzles, songs etc., which make up a precious literary tradition. Chăm people have songs for+fishing using the 'vai chai' rhythm (pwoc jah), betrothals (danh dom da ra), milling rice (danh rasung chai) etc. These rhythms are also sung during festivities with dances which have become a real attraction to spectators. Surely the greatest and most unique contribution from the Chăm culture is their architecture and carvings Historical stupa compounds in Mỹ Sơn (Quảng Nam-Đà Nẵng), Tháp Bà (Nha Trang), Tháp Chàm (Ninh Thuận) and various Tara statues in Đông Dương, and Apsaras in Trà Kiệu have all had their position+confirmed in the Southeast Asian sculptural tradition.+Though most of these works were created for religious purposes and stemmed from Brahmin spiritualism, they became popularised and part of the Chăm+national culture. As such, the Indian-inspired Vishnus, and Shivas went through considerable transformations and became more human when recreated by Chăm artisans.=In the present day, the Chăm people have adjusted their lives to local conditions. People in Tây Ninh mostly work in agriculture, fishing and+commerce while those who live near Saigon have developed an urban lifestyle. The majority, however, still maintain traditional professions like cultivation, husbandry, weaving and ceramic production. Chăm+handicrafts are now exported to various countries where they are highly appreciated due to their unique style and high quality workmanship

cơm	(noun) Flesh, pulp (of fruit); Meal
cơm	(adj) Scrawny, thin and stunted; Bent-backed
cơm	(noun) Green rice flakes; Rice growing farmers are the only ones who truly understand when it is time to gather young grains to make Cốm. Then young rice grains are harvested, roasted and ground down to become Cốm. They are put into a large firing pan under small flames and stirred slowly for a specific period of time. They are then poured into a rice mortar and slightly pounded with a wooden pestle, rythmically and at quick intervals until the husk is removed. Following this, the young rice is removed from the mortar and winnowed before being poured again into the mortar and the process repeated. This is then repeated exactly seven times so that all the husk is removed from the young sticky grains. If the pounding is done irregularly and in haste, or it is not repeated for the prescribed seven times, the green colour of the grains will disappear and be replaced by an unexpected brown colour. Cốm is regarded as a purely pastoral gift. To enjoy Cốm, it is advisable to chew it slowly so that one can feel the stickiness of the young rice and at the same time enjoy its sweet, fragrant taste. Visitors to Vong village (about five km from Hanoi) during the Cốm making season will have a chance to listen to the special rythmic pounding of wooden pestles against mortars filled with young rice and see women shifting and winnowing the pounded young rice

trong com	Cylindrical drum; LEGEND OF ""TRỐNG CƠM"". A famous song from Vietnamese folklore goes thus: ""How joyful to have a Trống Cơm; and it is an honour for those who can clap it skilfully...""The lyrics and the melody are usually accompanied by a picture showing boy or girl drummers with axehead-shaped turbans over their heads and long-shaped drums hung loose from the neck down to about the belly... All these easily mislead the audience to believe that Trống Cơm (the Vietnamese cylindrical drum) is an ordinary musical instrument. In fact, in the national musical instrument ensemble, Trống Cơm contributes an unique sound - now happy and cheerful, now low, soft and woeful recalling the innermost feelings of one's native country, one's homeland...The drum is held at both ends by a strip hanging over the performer's neck. It thus lie horizontally against the belly of the drummer who uses both hands to clap the drumheads. In the past, people stuck a handful of glutinous rice to each drumhead. Trống Cơm is used in worshipping and various ceremonies, in chèo (traditional operetta) and in Phường Bát Âm or an octet (a popular ensemble of eight instrumental timbres). The glutinous rice stuck against the drumhead lends its name to the drum (Trống Cơm in Vietnamese literally means ""Rice Drum""). Legend goes that once upon a time, there was a poor Confucian disciple who was very unlucky in competitions and examinations and had to go begging. Everyday, he went past the mansion of a wealthy family where there was always a girl waiting to give him rice. One day, so moved and also ashamed by her good deed, the young man came to thank the girl. She however said that she had done just what she had been ordered to do by her young mistress. Learning that, the man requested to see the mistress, who was a kind-hearted girl. Seeing the poor scholar bowing with joined hands, the damsel hurriedly bent down to raise him and said: ""Never mind, please! I understand and sympathize with your unlucky lot. Since you depart now, I would like to give you a small sum as travelling expenses and this golden hair pin in the earnest hope that one day you will succeed in making both a living and your way in the world and come back to the native land, and then..."". The girl left the sentence unfinished, but the scholar had got the message. Fully conscious of his fated misfortune at the workplace and in his pursuit of fame, he decided to turn to music with a determination to achieve success. As time passed, he became famous. Bearing in mind the old promise, he returned to the native village, hoping to meet again his benefactor. Unfortunately, upon arrival, he learnt that the damsel had just passed away due to illness. In his great lament, the young man brought along his musical instrumentalist guild to pay tributes to the deceased and himself created a small, cylindrical drum with rice stuck against both drumheads in commemoration of the ill-fated girl. The strip from which the drum was hung was made of white cloth symbolizing the mourning band. And as he clapped the drumheads, the doleful sounds echoed his deep pain and the loss of his sweetheart

Phong Trao Yeu Nuoc	Phong Trào Yêu Nước signifies "" Patriotic movements"".; Resistance war against Nam Hán Dynasty (938): In 938, from Châu ái (Thanh Hoá), Ngô Quyền led his army to the North to punish the traitor Kiều Công Tiễn who would seek reinforcements from Nam Hán Dynasty In late 938, the king of Nam Hán Dynasty ordered his son Hoằng Thao to command the navy for an attack on our country while stationing personally the rescue troops in Kwangtung (China). Ngô Quyền took Đại La Citadel, killed Kiều Công Tiễn and made preparations for the oncoming resistance war. The Nam Hán troops were defeated and Hoằng Thao was killed in action on Bạch Đằng river. The king of Nam Hán Dynasty cancelled marching orders and gave up his aggression intention. The resistance war against Nam Hán brought an end to more than 1,000 years of Chinese domination.; Anti-Tống resistance wars: After King Đinh Tiên Hoàng had been murdered, his son was too young (6 years old) when succeeding him. On this occasion, the Tống Chinese dynasty launched a large-scale aggression on Đại Cồ Việt (future Vietnam). Proclaimed king, Lê Hoàn (future Lê Đại Hành) hastened to prepare for an anti-Tống resistance war. In early 981, the Tống navy and infantry rushed overwhelmingly into Đại Cồ Việt. The enemy navy was beaten to pieces on Bạch Đằng River The enemy infantry was stopped short in Lạng Sơn and strictly pursued Their commander-in-chief Hầu Nhân Bảo was killed in action. The Tống dynasty resigned itself to cancel marching orders. Aware of Tống Dynasty's aggression intention, Lý Thường Kiệt took the initiative to attack it first for a self-defence. In October 1075, Lý Thường Kiệt commanded the navy to occupy the Khâm Chau, Liêm Chau estuaries and to besiege Ung Châu Citadel while destroying its food warehouses Then he hastened to come home to set up the defence line on the Cầu river for an oncoming resistance war. In late 1075, the Tống troops rushed into Vietnam with the determination of occupying Thăng Long, but after two attacks, were stopped short at the aforesaid defence line and gradually worn out. In addition, the Tống navy was stopped short at sea In early 1077, Lý Thường Kiệt switched to a strategic counter-offensive. The Tống army resigned itself to ""make peace"", then went home in March 1077. The Tống dynasty's aggression intention was crushed since.; Anti-Mongol resistance wars (13th century): In 1258, trying in vain to entice Nhà Trần (Trần Dynasty) into surrender, the Mongol dynasty ordered its 30,000 soldiers to invade our country. Trần Thủ Độ, Trần Quốc Tuấn (Trần Hưng Đạo) and our king withdrew out of Thăng Long, then all of a sudden made a counter-offensive. The enemy ran back to China in an utterly agitated state. In 1285, the crown prince Thoát Hoan (Togan) led 500,000 soldiers to attack Vietnam. The Trần troops withdrew temporarily to make a guerilla war before launching a general counter-offensive. The invaders ran helter skelter, and Thoát Hoan escaped by creeping into a bronze pipe. In 1287, the Mongol dynasty mobilized 500,000 soldiers (strengthened with navy and food supply fleet) for the third invasion on Vietnam. They were defeated again on Bạch Đằng River (1288) by the Trần troops under the command of Trần Quốc Tuấn (Trần Hưng Đạo).; Anti-Ming resistance war: Under the pretext of overthrowing Hồ Dynasty to restore Nhà Trần (Trần Dynasty), two hundred thousand Ming aggressors rushed into our country in 1406. To prepare for an anti-aggression war, Hồ Dynasty had set up a 400-kilometre long defence line from Tản Viên Mountain to Nam Hà (Hà Bắc). But the resistance was unsuccessful. On January 20th 1407, the Ming invaders mastered Đa Bang (present-day Hà Tây) - key position on that defence line - and flooded into Thăng Long on January 22nd 1407. Consequently, the Hồ army resigned itself to come back to Thanh Hoá. In June 1407, Hồ Quý Ly and his trusted courtiers were captured and taken to China. Our country fell again to the foreign domination after nearly five centuries of independence.* Lam Sơn Insurrection (1418-1428): In 1406, under the pretext of overthrowing Hồ Dynasty to restore Nhà Trần (Trần Dynasty), Ming Dynasty invaded our country. In 1418, in Lam Sơn forests (Thanh Hoá), Lê Lợi (future Lê Thái Tổ) launched a 10-year insurrection with the wholehearted help of Nguyễn Trãi. Between 1418 and 1423, the guerilla war endured many disadvantages due to the enemy blockade. Between 423 and 1424, the insurgents made negotiations to keep their strength intact. Between 1424 and 1425, they were on the offensive by liberating Nghệ An, Thanh Hoá, Tân Bình (Quảng Bình), Thuận Hoá. Between 1425 and 1428, they launched the general offensive throughout the country. Resounding victories were Tốt Động-Chúc Động, Chi Lăng-Xương Giang. On December 16th 1427, at Đông Quan (Hà Nội), Vương Thông declared to withdraw his Ming troops. In January 1428, all the Ming invaders left Vietnam.; Anti-Manchurian resistance war (1788-1789): From the fact Lê Chiêu Thống had sought reinforcements from China, the Manchurian dynasty ordered Tôn Sĩ Nghị and 200,000 soldiers to invade Vietnam. By Ngô Thì Nhậm 's plan, the Tây Sơn troops left Bắc Hà to return to Tam Điệp (Ninh Bình) and Biên Sơn (Thanh Hoá). Just after receiving this information (Dec.21st 1788), Nguyễn Huệ proclaimed himself emperor Quang Trung and gave marching orders without any delay. Within 35 days, Nguyễn Hue^.'s troops took the Gián Khẩu post at 90km from Thăng Long. In the night of January 28th 1789, they forced the Hà Hồi post (at 20km from Thăng Long) to surrender. In the morning of January 0th, the Ngọc Hồi, Khương Thượng and Đống Đa posts fell to Nguyễn Huệ. The Manchurian general Sầm Nghi Đống committed suicide by hanging himself. The Tây Sơn army flooded into Thăng Long Tôn Sĩ Nghị (commander-in-chief of the Manchurian troops) escaped by crossing the pontoon bridge on Sông Hồng (Red River). To avoid the Tây Sơn army's pursuit, Tôn Sĩ Nghị ordered to cut the pontoon bridge and an enormous number of invaders drowned. In the afternoon of January 30th 789, Quang Trung and his main army flooded into Thăng Long. The victory over the Manchurian aggressors was one of the most resounding feats of arms in Vietnamese history.; Ba Đình Insurrection (1886-1887) was commanded by Phạm Bành and Đinh Công Tráng against the French. Ba Đình referred to three temples in three villages Thượng Thọ, Mậu Thịnh, Mỹ Khê. The aggressors suffered many heavy losses due to that solid revolutionary base. After two unsuccessful attacks, the French besieged it so severely that the insurgents moved to Mã Cao (Thanh Hoá) and disintegrated. Phạm Bành committed suicide and Đinh Công Tráng was killed.; Bãi Sậy Insurrection was commanded by Nguyễn Thiện Thuật and Đốc Tít in response to Cần Vương Decree. The base was very solid and inaccessible to the enemy. The insurgents applied skilfully the guerilla tactics and inflicted numberless damages to the French between 885 and 1892. Later, Nguyễn Thiện Thuật had to flee in China and Đốc Tít was exiled to Algeria.; Hương Khê Insurrection was commanded by Phan Đình Phùng and Cao Thắng in response to Cần Vương Decree. Their base located in the Hương Sơn forests (Hà Tĩnh). Being able to make the rifles in the latest style, the insurgents achieved the Vũ Quang resounding victory.; Thái Nguyên Insurrection referred to the one of Vietnamese soldiers and prisoners under the command of Đội Cấn (Sergeant Can) and Lương Ngọc Quyến. After having killed the French commander, the insurgents liberated 203 prisoners and mastered the provincial capital. 623 insurgents (workers, peasants and civil servants included) had to face more than 2,000 French soldiers supported by artillery and navy
Phong Trao Yeu Nuoc	Phong Trào Yêu Nước signifies "" Patriotic movements"".; Resistance war against Nam Hán Dynasty (938): In 938, from Châu ái (Thanh Hoá), Ngô Quyền led his army to the North to punish the traitor Kiều Công Tiễn who would seek reinforcements from Nam Hán Dynasty In late 938, the king of Nam Hán Dynasty ordered his son Hoằng Thao to command the navy for an attack on our country while stationing personally the rescue troops in Kwangtung (China). Ngô Quyền took Đại La Citadel, killed Kiều Công Tiễn and made preparations for the oncoming resistance war. The Nam Hán troops were defeated and Hoằng Thao was killed in action on Bạch Đằng river. The king of Nam Hán Dynasty cancelled marching orders and gave up his aggression intention. The resistance war against Nam Hán brought an end to more than 1,000 years of Chinese domination.; Anti-Tống resistance wars: After King Đinh Tiên Hoàng had been murdered, his son was too young (6 years old) when succeeding him. On this occasion, the Tống Chinese dynasty launched a large-scale aggression on Đại Cồ Việt (future Vietnam). Proclaimed king, Lê Hoàn (future Lê Đại Hành) hastened to prepare for an anti-Tống resistance war. In early 981, the Tống navy and infantry rushed overwhelmingly into Đại Cồ Việt. The enemy navy was beaten to pieces on Bạch Đằng River The enemy infantry was stopped short in Lạng Sơn and strictly pursued Their commander-in-chief Hầu Nhân Bảo was killed in action. The Tống dynasty resigned itself to cancel marching orders. Aware of Tống Dynasty's aggression intention, Lý Thường Kiệt took the initiative to attack it first for a self-defence. In October 1075, Lý Thường Kiệt commanded the navy to occupy the Khâm Chau, Liêm Chau estuaries and to besiege Ung Châu Citadel while destroying its food warehouses Then he hastened to come home to set up the defence line on the Cầu river for an oncoming resistance war. In late 1075, the Tống troops rushed into Vietnam with the determination of occupying Thăng Long, but after two attacks, were stopped short at the aforesaid defence line and gradually worn out. In addition, the Tống navy was stopped short at sea In early 1077, Lý Thường Kiệt switched to a strategic counter-offensive. The Tống army resigned itself to ""make peace"", then went home in March 1077. The Tống dynasty's aggression intention was crushed since.; Anti-Mongol resistance wars (13th century): In 1258, trying in vain to entice Nhà Trần (Trần Dynasty) into surrender, the Mongol dynasty ordered its 30,000 soldiers to invade our country. Trần Thủ Độ, Trần Quốc Tuấn (Trần Hưng Đạo) and our king withdrew out of Thăng Long, then all of a sudden made a counter-offensive. The enemy ran back to China in an utterly agitated state. In 1285, the crown prince Thoát Hoan (Togan) led 500,000 soldiers to attack Vietnam. The Trần troops withdrew temporarily to make a guerilla war before launching a general counter-offensive. The invaders ran helter skelter, and Thoát Hoan escaped by creeping into a bronze pipe. In 1287, the Mongol dynasty mobilized 500,000 soldiers (strengthened with navy and food supply fleet) for the third invasion on Vietnam. They were defeated again on Bạch Đằng River (1288) by the Trần troops under the command of Trần Quốc Tuấn (Trần Hưng Đạo).; Anti-Ming resistance war: Under the pretext of overthrowing Hồ Dynasty to restore Nhà Trần (Trần Dynasty), two hundred thousand Ming aggressors rushed into our country in 1406.

ca tru	Ca Trù - an original art performance of academic character - has been preserved for the past 10 centuries.To appreciate Ca Trù is to appreciate poetry and music. Ca Trù appeared officially under Nhà Hậu Lý (11th century). First, it served royal and religious rituals and was called Hát Khuôn. Later, it was used in banquets, weddings, friendly meetings... and called Hát Hàng Hoạ Ca Trù had bamboo castanets as principal+instrument. By beating time on tomtoms, spectators accompanied and praised the singer. Ca Trù was also called Hát Nhà Trò (singing or dancing while pulling funny tricks), Hát Thưởng (Singing to be rewarded by king or mandarins), Hát Cửa Quyền (singing in royal palaces), Hát Cửa Đình (singing for religious rituals), Hát ả đào (name of a famous songstress in the Lý times).... Under the French domination, Ca Trù declined. Nowadays, it is restored as a type of original popular art; What is a Ca Trù declamation? Originally, Ca Trù was like chèo singing and served at ceremonies and festivals in the northern delta. When these ceremonies and festivals were no longer held, Ca Trù became a type of chamber music serving as intellectual food for those who would like to enjoy music and poetry; Music and poetry are the basis of Ca Trù and decide which ensemble of principal instruments, musicians and subordinate instruments should provide the accompaniment. Ca Trù has many melodies that are sung differently, but the chief is singing-reciting: A singer and a musician playing a long-necked lute-like instrument. Also taking part is a member of the audience who expresses his appreciation and response by beating a drum. A rather special description fits the songstress of former days: ""Fine clothes, velvet turban, delicate bobtailed hair, a moon-shaped face, knife-sharp eyes, refined manners, with sweet words, mild as flowers, transparent as snow, her beauty and charm are second only to Kim Vân Kiều's..."" To perform as expected, the+singer must practise very hard and know many tunes. A male musician accompanies the singer. He too practises hard so as to be in perfect harmony with the singer. The music accompaniment consists of a ""phách"" - a bamboo instrument beaten with two wooden sticks - and ""trống chầu"" - a drum beaten by a member of the audience in appreciation or comment. Of course, this member of the audience is very experienced at beating the drum - a single beat, three or five successive beats and nine beats at the climax to be ""in tune"" with the lute. A timely response by the drummer encourages the singer who knows that she has met someone who both understands and appreciates her talent. These three instruments: The lute, the ""phách"" and the ""trống chầu"" are inseparable. Being a subordinate+instrument, the drum is essential as a bridge between the performer and audience. The harmonious combination of the lute, the ""phách"" and the+human voice makes it a perfect performance as praised in these lines by Vũ Hoàng Chương: Sweet phach, passionate lute mild smoke cushion. The sad voice lingers on in the middle of night. To enjoy Ca Trù is to enjoy both music and singing. The art of Ca Trù is both high and original. Its sound range originates from that of the lullaby in the Red River delta. Ca Trù - with water puppetry - is+indigenous to Vietnam. It is a valuable legacy for Vietnamese culture; Many talented poets like Chu Mạnh Trinh, Nguyễn Công Trứ, Tú Xương, Dương Khuê and Tản Đà composed excellent tunes, extraordinarily pure and high-falutin to charm the audience.+At the beginning of the 20th century, before the 1945, there were many places where Ca Trù was performed: Khâm Thiên, Bồ Đề, Lộ Khê (Hanoi); Quan Ba Mau, Quỳnh Cư (Hải Phòng) and throughout Bắc Ninh, Hải Dương and Nam Định provinces. But then, Ca Trù became Cô Đầu - performed by a sing-song girl or type of geisha. The art of Ca Trù was forgotten because it was thought to be a product of the ruling+class; the singers whores and the audience no more than hedonists. Singers abandoned their careers because of this bias and inhabitants of the Khâm Thiên area even left their homes because of it. Before 1976, musician Nguyễn Xuân Khoát was the only Vietnamese musicologist to study Ca Trù. Ca Trù artists are still rare now, but attention is being given their art. Lộ Khê village, Phu Do (in Hà Nội) is considered the cradle of Ca Trù and on the 6th of the 4th lunar month and the 13th of the tenth lunar month each year, members of the Ca Trù circle hold initiator-worshipping celebrations Artists young and old sing the Ca Trù, always beginning with two pieces: Non Mai and Hồng Hạnh.+The artist who deserves most praise for the revival and world-wide spread of Ca Trù is Doctor-Professor Trần Văn Khệ He has recorded Ca Trù, Quan Họ and chèo songs and declamations and sent them to France for the UNESCO Musical Committee to study. As a result, many recordings of Ca Trù and Quan Họ songs have been made. The support of eminent artist Quách Thị Hồ has made the recordings a great success. All the original features of Ca Trù are prominent, and Hồ was evaluated by the Musical+Committee and awarded with an honorary commendation with these lines: ""We thank you for your contribution to the keeping of an original, traditional art legacy of Vietnam and an exceptional delicacy of mankind"". Since then, Vietnam has sent a delegation to an Asian tribute held in the People's Democratic Republic of Korea where Ho^`'s recordings were among the most honoured. A Ca Trù club has been established in Hà Nội, a place for all of Vietnam's excellent Ca Trù artists. It not only revives an old+musical form but attracts foreign musicologists: American, English, German and Japanese. American researcher Mirada Krenzen has written a persuasive study, Vietnam's Traditional Music Process. It was presented at a seminar to discuss Vietnam's traditional music in Hà Nội in 1994. Krenzen possesses a deep knowledge of Ca Trù and has gained the admiration of Vietnamese musicologists. She wrote: ""Ca Trù seems to have a magic power, a fermented substance to charm the listeners. Once I understood Ca Trù, I understood the Vietnamese people better"". It is possible that Ca Trù is a patch of the Vietnamese soul that Krenzen has understood? ()

nhac cu	(noun) Musical instrument; VIETNAMESE TRADITIONAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS: Vietnamese traditional instruments have a rich capacity for expression and are unique. This is shown in many ways. In general, Vietnamese traditional instruments are of simple structure. Sometimes too simple to be called instruments. For example, the leaf-horn has only two requirements: The surface of the leaf should be smooth and the leaf itself not thick. A girl holds the ""horn"" by the edge in her mouth and begins to produce a shrill sound. After a ""performance,"" the instrument can be thrown away. The jew's harp is only a piece of kouniak or ear of rice. Pitot, another flute, has only two holes - one for blowing and the other for fingering - but it can produce music written from the five-note scale. Castanets are simply two bamboo pieces; a bamboo end can become a split drum; a set of kouniak sticks of various lengths serves as a t'rung. Materials for making these instruments are available at home. The worm's silk will make strings and bamboo, kouniak and gourd covering is available in the garden. Further afield can be found bamboo, kouniak, wood, clay, leather, stonẹ.. Only the parts of instruments are difficult to make. For example, with an organ the trick is to stick a reed into one end for blowing. But simple or not, these instruments are so skilfully made as to be works of art. Their sizes are also unique. Clappers can be as small as a longan kernel; the jew's harp is exactly like an ear of rice; a certain drum is no bigger than a lemon. Other instruments are huge. The lithophone, or Ndut Lieng Krak, is 01.7cm long and the Khánh Sơn 103cm while lithophones found in other parts of the world are only 80cm long. The Qui Dien bell, cast in 1080 in the times of Nhà Hậu Lý and Nhà Trần, needed a 26 meter-high bell tower to house it. Another bell of the same period was cast in about 4,200 tonnes of bronze. The Van Ban bell with 180 tons in weight, made under Nhà Trần, is 127cm high and has a diameter 74 cm. The bronze drum, especially the Son Dong drum, is huge, imposing and beautiful. The Thunder drum, which sounds like thunder, has a 148 cm diameter and is 170 cm high Some drums have a circumference of two metres and are made from the trunk of a banyan tree. Gongs and cymbals range from saucer-size to a plate 90cm in diameter. The different sizes mean that Vietnamese traditional instruments all carry characteristics stemming from the artistic creativity of the people.=The đàn nguyệt, moon-shaped lute, and đàn dây, lute, both have high+frets and strings which are never too tight - and not without reason. The strings must be made from worm's thread and the strings and frets are made longer and higher so that the musician can use luring and stressing techniques. The traverse flute, the end-blown flute, the Vietnamese trumpet, the pi-let, the xa-ra-nai- traditional instruments of various ethnic groups-all have plain finger holes without finger devices so that the musician is free to use luring and stressing techniques. The Sing Tien-a type of clapper- is a very simple instrument, but a really creative combination of three well-known instruments: The guiro, the maracas and castanets. All these instruments have made their contributions to traditional Vietnamese music. But the instruments designed so long ago suffer some limitations. One of these is low volume. With the exception of idiophones, membranophones and some wind instruments, almost all traditional instruments make a low sound with short vibrations; Nevertheless, their capacity is both abundant and unique. On the đàn nguyệt, the musician is able to ""stress"" a note making it a triple-interval higher note or vice versa. The đàn dây, a type of lute, also has available a ""loose stress"" and on the đàn bầu, monocord, a half-note, a third of a note, a quarter of a note and perhaps even less than a quarter of a note can be created. An even more subtle characteristic of the monocord is that the fingered string, touched, can produce a note lower than that made by the unfingered string. This cannot be done on any other instruments. The one-stringed monocord has a three-octave range, although some improved monocords have a four-octave range. The klongput makes sound without being touched by the musician Another technique worthy of study is that which allows musicians to play such horns as pile and xaranai to make a continuous sound without pausing or stopping. Vietnamese traditional instruments are close to the lives of the people and their activities. Vietnamese instruments - particularly primitive instruments - are part of their activities.=The Thái make the tang bu from bamboo poles and water bags; from pestal and mortar the Mường make the Duong; from sticks to make holes in the ground for sowing, the Khơmu make the Kle Kla; others are the ding pa, klong put of the highlanders; the stones hung over a waterfall to make a sound when struck together and used to drive off beasts gave these groups the inspiration to make the very ancient lithophone; an elevated wicker string above a plank-covered hole is called rong Quan and was the prototype for the fantastic monocord; the Phong Tiêu, a type of flute, which reminds the listener of a kite flute and the To diep, Ky pa are not remote from the highland hunters' beast-calling horn; the never-ending sound of the wind in caves and caverns, or on hills where kouniaks have been felled, served as tangible models for highlanders voong to be hung before the Nhà Rông, or village hall, so that the wind makes a concert throughout the year. The lithophone is both musical instrument and a holy object. The gong and the cymbal are both musical instruments and precious and religious objects. Vietnam's musical instruments spring from real life and were made by creative laborers. The instruments were, and are, crucial to cultural life

Thời Đại Hùng Vương	It was in Thời Đại Hùng Vương (Hùng Vương Era) that the first State of the Vietnamese people (Văn Lang nation of the Lạc Việt people) took shape. By the C14 radioactive method, the archaeologists demonstrate that Hùng Vương Era was not legendary (18 Hung kings of the Hồng Bàng times were only symbolical). The inhabitants grew vegetables and tubers (especially sticky rice), bred chickens,pigs, dogs, buffaloes and oxen. The hunting and fishing activities were secondary. The casting and forging technics appeared in Đông Sơn Culture (see also Các Nền Văn Hoá Ỗ Việt Nam). The carpentry and the earthenwares were rather prosperous. The usual clothes included embroidered skirts and brassieres The food included bánh chưng and bánh giầy (square cakes made of sticky rice), wine, pickled fish, betel-nuts.. The spiritual life consisted of singing, dancing, carving, painting, tattooing. Sun, angels and totems were worshipped. Differentiation between the rich and the poor resulted in social differentiation, and Văn Lang nation came into being

ngon ngu	(noun) Language; The Vietnamese language belongs to a language group which was established quite a long time ago in East Asia. However, changes in material conditions over many centuries and the increasing demands of cultural life increased the development of the Vietnamese language, both spoken and written. While adopting many elements of the Chinese language, the Vietnamese people creatively Vietnamized many Chinese words, and they gradually became Han-Viet (Chinese-Vietnamese), incorporated alongside purely Vietnamese words. The Vietnamization was not only applied to the Chinese language however, but also to the French and other languages to create a great, diversified, vital vocabulary for the Vietnamese language

chèo	(verb) To row
chèo	(noun) Oar; Traditional operetta; Chèo (Traditional operetta) is an original synthesis of folk songs, dances and narration. The words of the play are imbued with the lyricism of folk songs, proverbs and popular sayings. A Chèo play could be put on stage in a large theatre, but it also could be performed successfully on one or two bed mats spread in the middle of a communal house with a cast of only three: a hero, a heroine and a clown. The clown in a Chèo play seems to be a supporting role, but actually he or she is very important to the performance. The clowns present a comic portrayal of social life, with ridiculous and satirical words and gestures they reduce the audience to tears of laughter. The national Chèo repertoire includes among others Truong Vien, Kim Nhan, Lưu Bình Dương Lễ and Quan Am Thị Kính, which are considered treasures of the traditional stage

Lac Long Quan	Lạc Long Quân - son of Kinh Dương Vương and Long Nữ (Long Vương's daughter) - had an unusual strength. His father entrusted him with governing the Lĩnh Nam region, suppressing the demons and teaching the people to grow water-rice, to cook rice and to cut wood for building houses. Lạc Long Quân married Âu Cơ - Đế Lai's daughter - who would give birth to a 100-egg bag hatching into 100 sons. 50 out of them followed their father to go down in sea, and the remainder followed their mother to go up in the mountains and became the ancestors of the Việt people. The eldest son was nobody other than King Hùng. So, the Việt people always consider themselves as "" Dragon's children, Fairy's grandchildren"". Geographically, this legend reflected the process of exploiting mountains and Northern Delta by the Việt people

Phan Boi Chau	Phan Bội Châu (Sào Nam, 1867-1940) - a strong-willed patriotic scholar with Phan Văn San as true name - had his native village in Nam Đàn ( Nghệ An). His father had been an unsuccessful Confucian scholar. Reputed for being an infant prodigy, he graduated as first laureate of interprovincial examination at the age of 33. With an anti-French strong will, he founded Hội Duy Tân (Association of Reformists). In 1905, he came to Japan to seek reinforcements and promoted the Đông Du (Advance towards the East) movement. Expelled in 1908, he came to China to found Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội (Association for Restoration of Vietnam) in 912, and was imprisoned in Kwantung (Quảng Đông) between 1913 and 917. After having met Nguyễn ái Quốc in 1925, he intended to change his strategies but was kidnapped in Shangai by the French. He was sentenced to hard labour for life, put under surveillance in Huế and died there. His life reflected the ups and downs of the Vietnamese revolution after the Cần Vương movement and before the birth of Indochinese Communist Party (constitutional monarchy - bourgeois democracy neo-democratic revolution). He wrote many works in Chinese and Vietnamese languages to awaken the patriotism, such as Hải Ngoại Huyết Thư, Ngục Trung Thư, Phan Bội Châu Niên Biểu, Khổng Học Đăng...

Hue	Today's Huế is the provincial capital of Thừa Thiên - Huế.The melancholy beauty of Huế, capital of the last Vietnamese feudal regime, derives from the quiet Sông Hương (Perfume River) weaving its course between rolling hills housing the temples and tombs of the Nguyễn Kings This feature of Huế has been enhanced by the recent addition of many modern hotels and offices on the banks of the river. On the southern bank of Perfume River, construction has started beside the Hương Giang Hotel for the new, three-star, 138-room Huế Hotel. Huế is one of the three biggest tourist centres of Vietnam. Its attraction lies first of all in the many temples, palaces and mausoleums of Nhà Nguyễn (Nguyễn Dynasty) built between 1805 and 1832. The old citadel measures 11 kilometres in circumference with a 21-metre thick wall and a flagpole standing 54.4 metres high. The Nguyễn kings, from Tự Đức and Minh Mạng to Đồng Khánh and Thiệu Trị were buried in mausoleums of different architectural styles. Huế also boasts nearly one hundred Buddhist pagodas and temples. Visitors should not miss Thiên Mụ Pagoda built in 1601 on a very poetic site on the bank of Perfume River, or the Từ Đàm pagoda.=Among Huế's many tourist attractions are Perfume River, Ngự Mountain, Tràng Tiền and Phú Xuân bridges, Vọng Cảnh (Belvedere) Hill, Bạch Mã (White Horse) Mountain, Hải Vân Pass, Tam Giang Lagoon, Thuận An and Cảnh Dương beaches and further north, the Cửa Tùng and Cửa Việt estuaries. Huế also boasts the National College which was attended by patriotic Vietnameses, Duong Mo village with fascinating records from the fight against the French, and the museum devoted to Phan Bội Châu, a prominent patriot during the early years of French domination. From Huế, you can rent a car from the Thừa Thiên - Huế tourist company to visit the system of tunnels in Vinh Moc village dug during the Vietnam war and Hiền Lương bridge at the demarcation line established between North and South Vietnam following the 1954 Geneva Conference. Then you can proceed to Cồn Tiên and Dốc Miếu, famous battle sites where vestiges of the US defence line are till visible, and further west, the mysterious Hồ Chí Minh Trail. Visitors will never be bored by monotony or repetition during a ten-day or five-day package tour of Huế. If you are an admirer of antiquities, you may order a ""royal feast"" at the Hương Giang Hotel or sit on a ""dragon"" rowboat (which used to cater for the royal family only) and listen to the mellow song of young girls rowing. If you want to watch the quiet glory of dusk over the Huong River you can hire a room at the Hương Giang or Huế hotels. If you like to listen to the lapping of sea waves, go to Tân Mỹ Hotel on the beach at Thuận An. If you want a completely still night, you may choose Thuận Hoá or Morin hotels. Wherever you go you will be treated to the most varied traditional dishes of Huế, prepared and served by lovely girls dressed in the violet ""áo dài"" (long gown) which is also a typical feature of Huế.=From Hà Nội or Saigon, you can reach Huế by air, land and water. A twice weekly air service has just been inaugurated between Phú Bài airport in Huế and Tân Sơn Nhất airport in Thành Phố Hồ Chí Minh. A similar service will soon operate between Huế and Hà Nội, and arrangements are being made with Thai Airlines to link Phú Bài with Bangkok. In 1991 the Thừa Thiên - Huế tourist company received 60,000 guests including 10,000 foreigners. Investment on infrastructure will increase from 4.2 billion dong in 1991 to 10.5 billion this year.With its present capacity, Huế can receive at any one time 1,100 guests at both state-owned hotels which have more than 500 rooms, plus at private mini-hotels and homes To know more about Hue, please search the entry Thừa Thiên - Huế

Binh Dinh	Quy Nhơn, provincial capital of Bình Định, is 1,065km from Hà Nội on National Highway 1. In the old days, Quy Nhơn was called Thị Nại, the name of a beautiful lake inside the city. Biển Quy Nhơn (Quy Nhon+Sea) has an annual average temperature of 25.7oC and is suitable for tourism the year round. Hoàng Hậu Beach is an ideal place for bathing. Quang Trung Museum is dedicated to Nguyễn Huệ, a national hero of the 18th century. It was built in his native land of Kien My village, Binh Thanh commune, Tây Sơn district, some 45km from Quy Nhon City. Nguyễn Huệ is one of three brothers who led the Tây Sơn Insurrection. In 1788, he led a great force advancing from Phú Xuân (Huế) to the North. It took 35 days and they exacted an overwhelming defeat on the Qing invaders near Thăng Long (now Hà Nội), thereby liberating the royal+capital. He crowned himself Emperor Quang Trung the same year. At Quang Trung Museum, visitors will enjoy music and demonstrations of Võ Tây Sơn (traditional martial arts of Bình Định). In particular, they can+see a young woman, a niece of the 9th generation of Emperor Quang Trung, playing 11 battle drums. In addition, Hoi Van village (Cat Trinh commune, Phù Cát district) is well known for its hot spring. It is composed of+various chemical components useful in the treatment of rheumatism, mental disorder, cardio-vascular diseases and skin diseases. Beside the hot spring, there is a sanatorium which offers steam baths with mineral water of 38oC useful for medical treatment and general health improvement.=Built in 1665 in the Đồ Bàn Citadel - second capital of the Kingdom of Chăm Pa some 27km from Quy Nhơn City - Thap Thap Pagoda is a Buddhist temple, but its decorations are characterized by the Chăm decorative art.

Lê Đại Hành	As an excellent strategist, Lê Đại Hành (941-1005) was the king founding Nhà Tiền Lê (Pre-Le Dynasty) (980-1009). His native land was in Thọ Xuân (Thanh Hoá). Born in a poor family, Lê Hoàn (future Lê Đại Hành) was an orphan from his early childhood but very studious. He was appointed as Commander-in-chief by Đinh Tiên Hoàng. In 979, after Đinh Tiên Hoàng had been assassinated, Lê Hoàn became the regent because Đinh Tiên Hoàng 's successor remained too young. In 980, the Tống Chinese dynasty prepared to annex our country. In 981, the queen mother Dương Vân Nga and the armed forces unanimously enthroned Lê Hoàng as Lê Đại Hành. In 981, Lê Đại Hành trounced the Tống invaders on Bạch Đằng River and at Chi Lăng Pass. After Lê Đại Ha`nh's death in 1005, his son Lê Long Đĩnh killed his elder brother to usurp the throne. Indulging in debauchery, this cruel king Lê Long Đĩnh always stretched out at the royal conferences, therefore he was also called Lê Ngoa. Triều (Ngoa. Triều means ""To stretch out at the royal conferences""). After his death, Lý Công Uẩn replaced him in 1009 and founded Nhà Hậu Lý (Post-Ly Dynasty)

Nguyen Trai	Nguyễn Trãi (1380-1442) - a great politician, strategist, diplomat, poet - was born in Thăng Long, and his paternal village located in Nhị Khê (Thường Tín - Hà Tây). His mother was the daughter of Trần Nguyên Đán (a high-ranking mandarin of Nhà Trần). His father was Nguyễn Phi Khanh who had graduated as doctor. At the age of 20, Nguyễn Trãi also graduated as doctor and served in the Hồ dynasty like his father. On the occurence of the Chinese invasion, Nguyễn Phi Khanh was captured and marched off to China. Nguyễn Trãi was kept under surveillance in Đông Quan (Thăng Long). Later, he fled in Lam Sơn to follow Lê Lợi (future Lê Thái Tổ), submitted Bình Ngô Sách (strategies of the people's war against the Ming invasion). After the enemy had been completely expelled, Nguyễn Trãi did his best to help Lê Lợi in the national reconstruction. In 1442, because of dishonest mandarins' great harm, Nguyễn Trãi and all his three related families were exterminated. His famous works were Bình Ngô Đại Cáo, Quân Trung Từ Mệnh Tập, Quốc Âm Thi Tập...

chieng	(noun) Gong; Gongs were found in Vietnam in the Bronze Age (Đông Sơn culture from 2000 to 3500 years ago). Gongs were cast in bronze, an alloy of copper, zinc and lead. Gongs are used as a musical instrument by most ethnic groups in Vietnam. Gongs are frequently mentioned in Highland songs, and its music displays its contemplative nature. Highlanders believe that when gong music is played, there is an encounter between the human and spirit worlds, between the worlds of the living and the dead. In real life, the gong is closely associated with each stage of a lifespan. In the ceremony of blowing the ear for a newborn child, the sound of a gong serves to declare the offical acceptance of a new community member. When he or she is old enough to get married, in the ceremony of exchanging necklace, the gong sound is a reminder to the new couple to observe family and community traditions. The sound is so deep that it seems to ring only once in one's life. When beasts are destroying crops or a war rages, the gong seems to urge young people to dash to the battlefield and struggle for the survival of the community. If the gong sounds hilarious and fast, it heralds a victory or the ceremony of killing buffalo. When the gong sounds slow, sinister and heavy, then it is the news of a death. The gong is warm in a night of rest or around a fire with a pot of wine, an indication of a good harvest when young people gather to sing and dance and tell of their love; When the gong sounds from the communal house, it can be heard all over the mountain and forest as a call for the young men to return to the communal house. When an old man passes away, the gong echoes its farewell. Virtually, all Western Highland and Long Range tribes have their own gongs. There are various types: Cồng (with a nipple) and Chiêng (without one) and there are also different sizes depending on the tribe, each region with its own regulations. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the gong is one of the main instruments in the orchestras of the Western Highland (Tây Nguyên) and Long Range (Trường Sơn) tribes, used in festivals such as the welcoming of a victory, killing buffalo, forgetting a tomb, and welcoming a good harvest. There are three pieces: Juar, Trum and Vang. Juar has an accelerating tempo revealing the majestic heroism of the victory; Trum (accompanied by a shield dance) expresses the hard but brave fight of the soldiers; and Vang, with a slow tempo, tells of sorrow, grief and regret felt for fallen soldiers. Gongs are named differently according to their size, register, timbre and function: Mother Gong, Father Gong, Older Sister Gong, Younger Sister Gong, or high pitch, medium pitch and low pitch. Hands or sticks are used to beat the gong. Sticks can be wrapped with cloth and/or rubber and a gong can be held by hand, put on the thigh or hung on a frame when played. Researchers all agree that of all the gongs of the ethnic groups, the Ba Na gong is the most majestic, imposing, romantic and echoing; the Gia Rai gong is the most solid, echoing and accelerated. The gong is an instrument of a philosophical and contemplative character. Closely associated with other art forms like singing and dancing, they can also be witty, cheerful and romantic. They are not only the property of the ethnic groups of the Western Highlands and the Long Range, but also bear unique and cherished value for Vietnamese culture as a whole. ()

Some 60km from the provincial capital is Pắc Bó, a small hamlet in Truong Ha commune, Hà Quảng district, close to the Vietnamese-Chinese border. In the local dialect, Pắc Bó means watershed, where springs of clear water run. From Thái Nguyên City, provincial capital of Bắc Thái province, you drive along Highway 3 to the towns of Bắc Cạn and Phu Thong. After another 16km, you will arrive at Ba Bể Lake which is about 225km from Hà Nội. The lake actually consists of three lakes called Pe Lam, Pe Lu and Pe Leng, so it is called Ba Bể (Three Seas). Ba Bể Lake is surrounded by limestone mountains and thick forests, home to many species of rare birds and animals

Viet	Việt ethnic group occupies 87% of the Vietnamese population. From the first residential area in Hồng (Red River), Cả and Mã basin, they gradually advanced southwards together with other ethnic groups. The concentration was noticeable in the deltas from lower section of Red River, Coastal Centre to lower section of Mekong River. Việt's residential sphere spread uninterruptedly from the Ngọc cape to Hà Tiên where the continental and oceanic ecological environments met each other The society was tightly organized in form of hamlets, villages, communes and townlets. Each village was a factor maintaining the traditional social structure of the Việt ethnic group and where small trade, agricultural and handicraft production took place. Its familiar landscapes resided in rice-fields, gardens, ponds, breeding and handicraft occupations Linguistically, there was the transition from Chinese language to nôm language, then to quốc ngữ (national language) with Latin-based letters in the late 19th century

Viet Nam	Vietnam; Different from China in the north, Vietnam referred to the Việt community in the south. Through its 4,000-year history, Việt Nam was named Văn Lang, Âu Lạc, Vạn Xuân, Đại Cồ Việt, Đại Việt, Đại Ngu, Đại Việt. Under Thời Bắc Thuộc (Chinese domination), Vietnam was called Giao Châu, An Nam Đô Hộ Phủ (Dominated An Nam). Since 1804, Nhà Nguyễn renamed this country Việt Nam. However, King Minh Mạng (Nhà Nguyễn - Nguyễn Dynasty) himself admitted that the name Việt Nam had existed long before. Nguyễn Trãi, Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm and Lê Quý Đôn had also used the name Việt Nam. In 1991, in Đồng Đăng (Lạng Sơn), the archaeologists discovered the Thủy Môn Đình stela with the words Việt Nam on it. Under the French domination, Vietnam was named An Nam, and An Nam also referred to Central Vietnam itself. The name Việt Nam has been officially and popularly used from 1945 till our days.; Besides 53 other ethnic groups (Dao, Ba Na, H'Mông, Hoa, Khơ Me, Mường, Mơ Nông, Nùng, Xơ Đăng, Thái, Gia Rai, Ê Đê, Chăm...), Việt (Việt or Kinh ethnic group) occupies up to 87% of the Vietnamese population. Many of ethnic minorities have the unnoticeable economic and cultural development, or remain in a primitive state.*See also Các Nền Văn Hoá Việt Nam

Thái	With nearly 900,000 inhabitants (1.45% of the Vietnamese population), Thái ethnic group is divided into Thái trắng (White Thái) and Thái đen (Black Thái) on the basis of the clothing colour. The residential sphere spreads from Red River right bank to Thanh Hoá, Nghệ An Highlands. It is easy for them to mix with native ethnic groups. They settle in valleys surrounding immense fields (Mường Thanh, Quang Huy, Than Uyên, Nghĩa Lộ), and live on farming, breeding, weaving. The Thái people has its own writing and a very developed popular culture; In the western part of Nghệ An Province, there reside about 13,000 ethnic Thais belonging to the sub-groups of Tay Thanh, Tay Muoi, and others. Like their counterparts in the North-West of the country, the Thái community here possesses a rich culture that has been built up over the centuries. In their everyday working life, the Thái minority has developed a rich and abundant culture. Many traditional rites and festivals exist along with other Thái cultural activities. In this article, we introduce one particular cultural event - the Thái's Cave-Picnicking Festival. According to the elders in the community, the Cave-Visiting Festival of the Thái people living in the mountain villages surrounding Quỳ Hợp dates back to time immemorial, and was in existence up to the middle of the twentieth century. Every year during the period from the 3rd through the 10th day of Tháng Giêng (the Lunar Year's first month following Nguyên Đán - the Lunar New Year's Day), the Thái folk in and around the locality flock to the Cave - Picnicking Festival The event takes place in Tham Mon (Mon Cave) located in the Châu Quy commune, Quỳ Hợp district. The Cave visitors are of all ages, but mainly single young people. They are natives from the villages of Quỳ Hợp and other neighbouring districts in West Nghệ An. Visitors are allowed to enter the cave only once a day until they find themselves a boy or girl friend, and return home when the festival ends. It is an inviolable rule that cave visitors must not bring in a lamp, fire or any source of light.+All visitors come into the cave for the festive occasion amid complete darkness. Young people first enter in groups, then disperse and move further into the dark cave. Once inside the cave, the girls usually gather in small groups of two or three, and stand timidly in the cave alleys. The boys, also in small groups, grope in the dark for girl friends. Every action must be made by hand, and every move made by foot as calling, speaking or shouting are completely forbiđen... Having found a friend of the opposite sex, the boy can talk with and court the girl in the cave. If they find each other suitable, the couple come out of the cave hand-in-hand and go to the boy's home to announce their love to his parents. The parents then take the responsibility of guardianship, by assisting and creating favourable conditions for the couple to become husband and wife. That the Festival takes place in such a dark cave makes it an extremely fun-filled and enjoyable experience. All unmarried Thái boys and girls are eager to go to the Cave- Visiting Festival to try their luck at seeking a life companion. The Thái men traditionally look for a pretty girl of marriageable age who must be well-built and in good health Therefore, in the cave, a boy first makes sure that he finds himself the right girl, that is, he asks in whispers after her name, her whereabouts and her parents so as not to mistake a blood sister or relative whom he cannot marry. He then feels her thoroughly to find out whether she is strong and sturdy. If satisfied, he then starts to exchange intimacies, courts her and ultimately leads her out of the cave. Such a play of courtship all in the dark cave with the boys fumbling for the girls who hide themselves in the cave gorges or alleys cannot be free of conflicts and jostlings among the men. A struggle inevitably ensues when a boy finds a girl who has a flaw and tries to get rid of her. Similar to practices such as the ""moonlight dance"" or ""moonlight stroll"" of some other ethnic minorities, the Cave - Picnicking Festival of the Thái community in western Nghệ An is a cultural activity - a community-gathering place for dating and courting couples.+It is a healthy practice and requires the participants to strictly adhere to the community's rules and customs. In earlier times, when social events were virtually non-existent among the Tháis, the Cave-Picnicking festival presented a good opportunity for young people to discover and exchange love. The Festival in fact was an indispensable part of the cultural life of the Thái people in western Nghệ An up to the first half of this century

âm nhạc	(noun) Music; The Kinh and all ethnic minorities in Vietnam have a time-honoured tradition of music and dance. This is evidenced by the figures seen dancing to music which were engraved on the bronze drums unearthed at Dong Son (Thanh Hoa province) and lithophones discovered in Tay Nguyen Highlands and other relics. Besides royal court music, there was also a rich vein of music which was closely attached to the daily lives of the working masses. Thousands of diverse musical tunes have been collected from this source. From Quan Ho folk songs in the North to Hue songs (songs from the Perfume River), ""guessing game"" songs, satirical songs, joking songs and numerous songs in southern provinces, all are characterised by a profound sensibility and poetic, lyrical sense. After 1945, royal court music was underdeveloped. But folk music flourished more than ever before along with the increasingly popular modern music
